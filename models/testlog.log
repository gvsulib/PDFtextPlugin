Library Council Survey

Library Council is seeking input (contributions that may change the outcome or direction of a
decision, project, or analysis) from all Libraries faculty and staff on how it can:
• Best serve the needs of employees from all designations
• Encourage deeper engagement and a sense of shared community
• Foster participatory management practices and collaborative decision-making across
the library
The following survey should take five to ten minutes to complete.
First, a quick refresher on the different leadership bodies for the GVSU Libraries and how they
relate to one another:

Executive Team
Consists of: Dean, Associate Deans, Administrative Assistant to the Dean
Focus:
• University level / libraries wide topics: budget planning, planning library-wide training
and events, strategic-level operational logistics, big-picture human resources issues, and
sometimes high-level facility use issues.
• Considers how the library as a unit interfaces with the rest of campus at an operational
level.

Leadership Team
Consists of: Executive Team, department heads, and Director of Archives and Special
Collections
Focus:
• Library decision-making and implementation of decisions.
o Example topics: library-wide approaches to human resources issues (such as how
to onboard new staff), library operations, resource management, strategic
thinking about future directions, and feasibility of potential future initiatives.

Library Council
Consists Of: Leadership Team and elected representatives from the major employee groups
(PSS, APs, Faculty)
Focus:
• With representation from the across the Libraries, Council provides insight on issues
such as outreach to campus (especially as it pertains to services), inter-departmental
operations level policy concerns, staff development, formulating specific strategic

•

initiatives, and planning and executing specific library wide initiatives such as
convocation.
Generates ideas for policies, issues and initiatives from the different employee classes.
There’s an expectation that elected representatives and Department Heads are in
communication with the groups they represent to bring forward issues that staff and
faculty want discussed at leadership levels.

One of the objectives of both council and leadership team is to help create engagement in
decision making across the library and increase transparency, so more people become involved
at each level.

until the age of 13. At that
time, her family moved to Kalamazoo> and that is where she
graduated from Central High

Kalamazoo is also
where she attended College.
She did attend Michigan State

so then went to Kellogg Community College {kornflake U).
Western Michigan was next,
and that is where she received
her B.3. in Education, majoring in Speech, History and
English.
She is currently

Wtile at Westernt she worked

In 28 of them, she performed.

LORETTA YOUNT

BUDDY RAPHAEL

Calm, cool and collected?
That sums up Loretta Yount
in a nutshell.
Not really,
but that's almost it.
Here
is a very reserved, quiet,
efficient lady, who says she
would rather stay in the
background than be "up
front". Never a hair out
of place 1 she always looks
as though she stepped out
of a band-box.
She is so
quiet that if you did not
see her about once in a while,
you would not know she is here.

How did I get this story?
It wasn't easy. Ever try
to catch a butterfly? Also
not easy. But I think it
would be easier than trying
to track down Buddy Raphael.
It took a lot of tricky
maneuvering, such as hiding
behind his desk to catch
him when he arrived in the
morning, calling him on the
phone and telling him it
was his mother, to tripping
him in the hall.
I had
thought of using a lasso or
butterfly net, but fortunately
didn't have to resort to
those tatics.
The important
thing is, I fin~lly did get
some information from him.
Buddy, who is Assistant
Director here at the Council,
was born Joseph Raphael in
Detroit, and was raised in
Peshawbestown. He is cf
Ottawa decent and is married
to a very very attractive
lady (who by the way happens
to be a Sioux from South
Dakota)t and has three
children.

Very efficient in her role
as Office Manager, Loretta
is a Potawatomi and has been
at· the Council since October
1974.
Formerly Loretta Wesaw,
she is married to Andrew
Yount and is mother to Andrea

and Dav.id.
In the hobby department, she
likes to sew and bowl.

that .she pretty much e'7ijoys.

ROGER SPRAGUE

LETTER OF RESIGNATION

We'd very much like to welcome Roger
Sprague as our new Director of
the Employment Resource Center
here.
And while he is new to this
position, he is by no means ne w to
the community OR the Council.
HJs most recent association here ,
was that of Cnairman of the Board
of Directors, from which he re cently resigned in order to fill
his new position at the Council .
It is my understanding too, that
he was one of the original organizers of the Council at its inception.

April 3, 1978

TO:

Members of the Board

FROM: Roger L. Sprague
SUBJECT: Resignation from the
Board

Dear Board Members:
It is with much regret that I must
resign as chairman of the board.
Effective right after this meeting.
There was a lot of thought over a
period of months before I came to
a decision.

An aura of quiet dignity surrounds
Roger who was born in Bradley,
Michigan and is both Potawatomi and

Ottawa.

·"--··-----~---"--·--------

He is married to Rita I.

Lett, who is also an Indian, but
from the British West Indies, and
they are the proud parents of five
children, Lee 18, Richard 17,
Janina 16, Michael 15, and Anthony
l.1 .

Sports of all kinds interest Roger,
and he has been the promoter and
coach of a lot of teams in tne
arfc:a.

My thinking is that I can serve
the Indian Community more effectively as Program Director of
Employment 1 at the Inter-Tribal
Council.
I am very proud to have served for
two different periods.
First as
Vice-Chairman for 21 years, then
as Chairman for 2 years, 9 months.
Watching our Council grow from
zero ground 10vel to what i t now
encompasses and the programs it
offers to help our comm~nity has

raade me very proud.

It shows what

a sound and intelligent board and
st~f! working together can accomplisn.

We knew that Roger will do great
in his new position.
Welcome aboard, Roger 1 and much success to
you!!!

I can only hope that the rest of
the board and the Community remembers
me as being an honest and ~edicated
board member and I can assure you
that I'll be the same person in
my new job.
I am confident that I'll leave the
board in competent hands, with a
nucleus of dedicated and hard working people to carry on.

Yours truly,
Roger L. Sprague

The movie is historically inaccurate.
Brutal violence by Native people is emphasized between humans
and towards animals.
Native men are portrayed as
extremely emotional, demonstrating either passive, or agressive behavior.
Native men are portrayed as
grunting, groaning idiots who
have uncontrollable lust for
white women and whiskey.

5.

The characte~ Iran Eyes Cody
portrays is a passive 1 mindless
slave to a white dominant male
(Lone Ranger and Tonto image).

6.

The woman is portrayed as pro perty of two men.

7.

The woman is portrayed as a
foolish., passive, screaming,
emotionally sick non-person.
The quality of the clothing,
and painted, glued beadwork
is not representational of
Indian arts and crafts.

The biggest percentage of Indians

The majority of federal resources

a decrease in federal funding for
reservations, I do believe that
the Indians not residing on reservations should be eligible f0r
federal benefits.
Theref o re, I am
directing the Commission on Indinn
Affairs to recommend ways for improving the availability of these
state and federal programs.
Finally, the Commission in cucrently
investigating methods to cla~ifv

Slowly, he turned around and followed
the trail back home. All the way there,
he kept thinking of the fate of the
butterfly. It ~{as sad that the butterfly had to die, when Little Deer tried
so hard to help it. When he reached
his home, he related his tale to his mother and father, with tears in his eyes.
Little Deer's father was a very wise man
and he said, "now Little Deer, the
butterfly was being born or hatched like
a bird is hatched from his shell. What
you thought was a trap was really only
a covering to protect him until he was
ready for this life. The butterfly needed
the struggle to get out of the covering
because the struggle would make him
strong so that he could survive J.n life.
But, because you . tried to help him in
that struggle he did not develope the
strength to survive. And so it is in all
of life, Little Deer. At some time or
other we all meet with a time, when we
will need to struggle through some difficulty. And it is somethi_ng we must do
alone. This way, we get the strength, _and.
we also learn how to get through other hard
times. If someone took that str~.tggle from
us, we would not learn. Do you understand now, Little Deer?"
"Oh yes father, 11
answered Little Deer 'and darted back off
to the .forest a little wiser.

THE STORY OF LITTLE DEER AND THE FLYING

WEL~~

ACT THREATENED

The following article is taken from the
bulletin of Americans for Indian Opportunity, 600 Second Street, N.W. it403,
Albuquerque, New Mexico
87102.

****•lE*
The Carter Administration has apparently
taken a position against the Indian
Child Welfare Act {S. 1214/HH). We be.lieve it to be an Office of Manae;ement and
Budget decision based on cost rather than
on the issue of' what's good for the Indian
children.
Testimony pre~ented to the President's
Commission on Mental Health indicates that
25% c>f all Indian children are removed
from Indian famiU es for some sort. of
placement.
The Bill, as you krrow, would go a long
way toward eliminating the abusive child
welfare practices that have led to the unwarranted separation of Indian children
from their families and towards allowing
Indian tribes the opportuni.ty to provide for their own children.
The Bill passed the Senate November 3,
1977.
It has been referred to the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Indian Affairs and should be acted on early in this
session. People in the Grand Rapids area
and all over the United States should
write letters to Congress!Tl{·irl Henry Reuss
and Clement Zablocki, House Offtce Building, Washington, D.C. Also write letters
to:
The Honorable ,Jimmy Carter
The President

THE ADVENTQRES OF ELMEfi AND OTIS_

Once upon a time, in old Mr. Jones' barnyard, there lived two fro~s nooned Elmer
and Otis. They used to frolic around the
barn and have all kinds of fun. Sometimes
for fun they would have contests to see
who could jump the farthest from the hayloft.

As he landed in a pile of hay, he noticed
something clinging to the bottom of his
foot. He wasn't certain a.t. first what is
was, but sure enough on the 'second look~
he knew for sure that it was butter!

INTRODUCING •••• -.

By Virglnia Medacco Herr
DONNA __DUNLOP

They sa.y still waters run deep, but in the
case of' Donr:a Dunlop, the waters run even
st.iller and deeper . . I'm happy to find

that out, because when I first arr:i.ved at
the Counc::i.l, I was under the false impression that this 1·emarkable young woman
did not. possess the power. of speech.
'rhis ma.y sound like an exaggeration, bur;
she really wa.fl quiet! And the mystifying
, thing about it, is that Denne>. was bo:rn
under the sign of' Leo, . And a.n.ybody who is
even remo~ely interested

in as_trology

will

know immediately that this is very 1.m-L•·'Olike.

through r"'d rimmed eyes and told him that
if she had only fifty cents she -wouJ.dn 't
bave to stay sick. The boy gave his mother a dollar and watched her f>louch away
on her :r·t:~n over shoes. He knew she was
going to the liquor store for wine.
He felt bad for a long time afier that. The
way he felt towards his parents kept his
mind in turmoil. He carried this burden
of guilt with him constantly from then on.
Ska--nee-gish liked to r0ad very much. Besides the nine cent movies and swimming,
reading was his way of spending his spare
time. On days when it r<dned or when he
got bacl:: to town early enough from ~addy­
ing, he began going to the public library.
He ·1:1ked the libra.ry a lot - peaceful and
quiet. '.I'here must have been tons of read:i.111:;;. His for the asking. He had only to

He 1.-as r;oi ng ·t;c get a book, go to the far

stuff th.:.d: made his ma and pa get so awful.

Before we wot.:1d rise from that seat this

From this writing he was to learn that alcoholism was ranked right up there with

He learned that an alcoholic wrJ.s sick three

and spiritually. And that this rlisease

couple times. I love you.

As soon as he was able. the father took
the only job he could find. It was the
poorest paid, and the men who worked at
this job were all ashamed of it. It was
the lowent job in the country. The WPA
The Works Progress Administration. A
government make up ,job. Just one step
ahead of outrjght welfare.

Your son.

'11hey did however, mm the old. house.

The boy worked and gave almost all he
ea1~ned to his mother.
He put it on the
dresser where he knew she would find it.
It was al ways gone when he ca.rne home. He
was beginning to get dir:F.!ou.ra.ged. Then
one day it started to harpen. The little
rn:i.racle began. He came he.me and his mother was sober. She told her son that
she was pretty sick but that she was going to tttough it out.n This she did.
It took about a week for her to "dry
out." '11hcn she began to clean the old

house & little at a time. The results
began to show. Clean floors, dishes
washed., 1atmdry done. Food waited for
him every day. It was nic:e having his
mom herself again. Her hair was combe,1.
Her clothes, though o1d, were clean.
True to his word he went t~) ehur:;b with
her. Life was looking up. He wasn't
lonely anymore.

Between them., the boy and father got thingf~
in shape. They first fixed the roof for
the coming winter. They didn't ha.ve mone:l' for paint but they did a.J.l they could
in the way of repairs.

The boy e::njoyed every moment of it. Working with bis dad. whom he l.oved very much
when sober.
His mom brought them leomonade to drink
while they worked. It was all so good.
Gone w&s the lonliness and humilation that
always keeps company w:ith ,drunkeness.

not loving hil:-1 pa.rents was gone. He had

a man becomes a threat to the outcome

of' the game, there are several plays in
football us~d to remove the threat of that
man. The men assigned to get this job done
are called 11 hatchet men." They must take
that.man out of tha game; break a. leg or
an arm, knock him u_~concious; ar1ything short
of Jill=i,iming him for 1ife; but ~~him.
And this is an accepred part of the ga."lle.
However cruel and inhumane it might seem,
it is honorable. The plan that tackle Devore and. back;> Ei;:;enhower and 0' Ha.re were
to use is called the "hi-lo." Devore was
to hit "that Indian 11 low about the knees
or lower. Red O'H.a.re and Ike were to hj_t
him from the opposite direction; high near

on his feet and staggered back to the Carl isle huddle. They couldn't believe their
eyes. No man could possibly get up after
thr:i.t terrible collision! 'l'hey were sure how-·
11

ever} that the Indian 11 wouldn't be carrying
the ball again, and they couldn't have been
more wrong!

Carlisle quarter back Welch stalled in the
huddle as long as he cou1d, giving his team
mate as much time.as he could to recover.

Suddenly, "that Indian" stuck his head up
from the huddle and shouted. across to the
11

INTRODUCING •..............
By Virginia Medacco Herr
DAWN BUSH
---·----

"I really have no hobbies outside of
sewing and traveling> 1'.mt I 'n: always
willing to try anything new." 'I'his
statement came from Dawn Bush, our
Assistant Outrea~h Director here at .the
Counc:i.l. A very competent and dedicated
worker she is too, which is obviuus from
all that she a.ccompli.ahes. fu.1d ii' I were
to make a judgement, I wculd say her
work :i.s almost her hobby, as she enjoys
it so much. Oh yes, she says she does
like to read poetry too.

Dawn; with the long dark hair, ca.me to
us in November 1976) a.nd is a Potawatomi,
born in Plainwell, Michigan. And again
I hate to overuse this word, but she does
1rn.v-e that same sense of humor that all
here at the Council have (must be,it's
contagious.)
Six year old Carey, four yea:r old Charlie
and three year old Charlotte call her
mommie) and she is very devo"':;ed to her
~~hrce

Davenport College a.nd OIC will be offering clerical classes, including
stenography·, typing, a.nd training for
medical secretaries.
Besides these referralr; the C~l!:TA I
program also wi.11 be of:fer:i.ng GED and
high school completion classes at
Lexington School and typing, filing
and shortharn.1 at the Council. A.Jl
participants v.ri11 be receiving career
planning co<.mseling, job seek:ing skills,
and job-placement and follow-u:p ·ho help
·[;he participant get the jo·b they want

children.

Dawn says happiness and

contentment an: her aims in life, and
tha.t she is young enough yet, that she
knows there are a lot of good things
ahead .
.And in closing. Dawn. Mav I ask. if one
of those "ne¥'1 thin,q;s you've tried is
''fluffed ham?"

BOO-SHOO!
The snow has finally started to fall.
Many people have awaited for this season
so long while others could do without it.
Anyways, it's good to know that the
white blanket of snow has fallen on our
Mother the Earth to keep her warm and
prepare her for the seasons to come.
I'm sure many of the cbildt•en are fascinated with the snowy season because to
them they know that with Christmas just
around the cocner it's the time of giving, get-together:;,, exchanging pres~nts,
setting up the family Christmas tree, and
yet another big dinner.

MY CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL PILLED THIP

PACKA LIFETIME OF MEMORIES
fNTONIN'ESHOR'TDA!s) .Part. two
(GR HOW TO

.

By Virginia Medacco Herr

Spirits still in high gear, I returned
from Stratford, on Friday October 6th,
at about 10 PM. I spent Saturday with
my family. But to unwind was impossible,
since the very next day I would be
boarding a plane wj. th my sister Ka thy
Bowen, and friend Dora Harris, for ·

Niagara Falls to attend the 10th annual
convention of the National Indian Education Associ.ation. Could this really
be me??? More adventures ahead! ! !
SUNDAY OCTOBER 8TH.

After a sleepless night (I mean honestly 1
how COULD I sleep'?), I was up and pack-ing. Bow did I 'get into all this'? Well,
being a member of the Kelloggsville
Schools Indian Parent Cormni ttee, I was
pursuaded t.o go by our Coodinatoc, Mr.
Timothy Moore.

Departure time was :::;oon upon us.

The
three of us went through that gi.smo
,
metal detector thtng, and then moved on,
but only after they were sure we were ·
not going to hi-jack tht plane and head
for Wounded Knee or the Little Big Horn
or someplace like that.
"Do you have your ticket.s? 11 asked my
practical level headed iistert (being
througl1ly fa.miliar with the anti.cs of
her scatter-brained sister).
"Of course I do!" I answered assuredly,
fumbled through my purse as a ;nae.
ter of routine. A more frantic effort
ensued to locate them 9 when they wern't
where I expected them to be. I just
knew they were j.n my purse. They were
there only a minute ago! Panic seized
me as I realized that they were no whe!'e
to be found in either purse or pockets,
and we were only minutes away from getas I

ting on tifiat plane.

'

11

I can ' t f'J.nd them! " I finally admitted,

and with that admission came a sinking
hcaet. and the !'ealization that if they
wer' not found and found quickly, I
would not be getting on that plane. Oh
wo1.:: is me! It could only happen t,o me.
I just knew it htas too 1-;ood to be true!
"Think!" said my level headed sister.
demanding the i.mpo.ssible at a time l:iKe
this. "Did you have them out, when we
were sitting out there? 11
nyes, I believe I did. But I'm sure I
put them back into my purse. 11

As we went back to tell the ladies at
the rrietal detec:tor gi;;mo about my plight r
Kathy remained calm. I was about to
faint. Adding to rny panic, Kathy said,
"Your expen~'Je money was also in that envelope wasn 1 t i.t?'1

Enscohscd in our seats - still in that
crdert I drifted into a joyful delirium
when the reality hit me that I was actually on that plane and would soon be
flying to Niagara Falls.
Seatbelts fastened, we were soon speeding down the runway, and with the sense
of leavtng one's tummy still earthbound ,
we shot what seemed to be, almost vert~­
ically upward!!! (Gee! What a thrill i t

must be for spacemen!) And need I say
:t LOV~ i_t_?,?'? Soon everything on the
earth became.~ minia t.ure and then grew
hazy as we merged into the clouds. And
before long, we were flying way ABOVE
those frothy looking things . - What
beauty!! l

"Yes," I muttered weakly.
.A.nd then the lady at the metal detecto1'
gismo who seemed to be made of metal ''herself said, "And anybody can get those
Lickets and turn them in for money. THEY
AHE AS GOOD AS CASH t ''

Upon wobbily 1egs aM with the support
oi both Dora and Kathy (on e:i.thcr side
of me,) I made it to the plane .

My heart grew

fainter!

Looking at us curiously from the other
uide of the metal detector gismo, stood
Kachy 1 s husband, that shy Cheyenne.
"Virginia lost her tickets! 11 Kathy
shouted to him. I was too weak to speak.

Well, here we sat. The three muskateers.
{or is that Mousekateers'?) He would
spend the rest of this ·day, plus f our
happy more together.
It seems we only just got up in this
lavish carnival ride when we started to
descend. Soon we were amongst the clouds

yet!" Oh.

"See if they are ont or near, the seats

with perfect calm.

In a moment the shy Cheyenne returned:
tickets in hand. Mentally I sent him
a million kisses in gratitude, because
I was still too numb to speak.
0h what a relief! I was beg.inning to
think that Virginia wasn;t go:Lng with
us . Thank you, Don."
11

Since I still had not regained the use
of my voice, I made a brei.f gesture indicatl.ng that I was ever so grateful.

Since we had an hour to kill, we decided
on some refreshments at a little establishment at the terminal. Kathy had a
wh.i.skey sour 1 Dora had some red wine and
1 had a bloody mary. Then we had lunch .
About five minutes before we were to
boa1·ci the plane to Buffalo , the nice
gentleman at the,ticket counter informed
us that the plan~ -·was full ! "No sea ts ! 11
said he.
"But we have tickets!" cried we.

INDIAN TRAILS
Indian trails now are gone
Gone l i.ke smoke in airy blue
faded <':·S their camp fire lights
Long since have faded too,

Here the warrior sought r'edrcss
Fr0m the shame of ill defeat
Going swiftly. str·ong and sure
On unerring, silent feet,
Here he fought to keep the land
Hills and plains that were his home
Fought to save his wigwam fires
From other warriors on the roam,
Proud his heart on battle trails,
On the trails he loved and knew
Trails that now have faded like
Wraiths of smoke in airy blue,
Fading, fading, fading still
Those trails the Indian knew
Growing dimmer though the years
Like wraith~ of smoke in airy blue

AND WRITTEN BY DONN/.\ 1 S GRANDMOTHER,

LAUHA PARKEY OF PETOSKEY, MICHIGAN.
Letter to the Editor of TURTLE TALK.
Dear

~·:ci tor,

I i..i:-;h to express my gratitude to the Grand
Rap;Lds Inter-Tribal Council for making it

pos.si.ble for the Elderly representatives
of the three majoc tribes of Michigan, the
Salem-Bradley Drum, and the Director of the
Michigan C.')mmission on Indian Affai1·s. to be
present at the dedication of the West River
Bank Park in downtown Grand Rapids. I also
want to thank all those from our local
Indi<:tn c;)nffiiunity 1 who in spi_te of the rain,
turned out to observe the ceremonies.

On November 15-17, 197E3 1 Vi Compo and l
attended the Michigan Commission ori
lndj_an Affairs Conference in Traverse

City. The Park Place Motor Inn hosted
tne many representatives from various
programs created for the Native Am(:rican concerns which included educat1on 7
employment, health 1 and housing, among
other ar~as of importance.

The presencs of Eld~rs at this conferwas our grounding and center. I attended a meeting of the Elders, and was
proud to hear and experience their determination to unify and then work for
the changes they want to see happr-n as
a result of' their Jong .struggle w.ith
the gc.'vermnent for good nousing, r"1.,.;tWithout our Elders contribution to the cled.1·- ri tion, heal th ser·vices, ascmred L-1cat i_')rJ it would have been jtrnt another dedi~ come 7 meaningful employment 1 an.J .;. life
cation. With them and the Drum and the.i.r
of' determination. An Elder fron t!1e
ope1dng ceremonies it had real meaning to
Detric•t Indian Center spok(; of tl1P r;eed
e~eryone present.
It was BeautiiUl!
to unify, commenting that the government rieyer Las 'l1or will ever meet, oy
ltself, the r.eeds of the Native El.dc:rs.
It is for the Elders, themselves, he
Bea Da~ley: R0pr0sentative of the Indian
r·eported, to ga tl1er together ar.d work
Co:nnunicy on. the West River-Bani- Par!<
for the way of .life thci.t the:y seek.

about colonial women, Linda Grant DePaw
states that Indian women had greater
economic, social, and political status than
colonial women. The mothers of the t.ribe
often had the final say when the warrior's

the tribe from going to war by refusiu.g to

somc3 congratulations. Jim, son of Marya.nne Fa.sburg recently too'.( f'Ome honors ir1

We are proud of you Jim!

Ross is a very tnteresting and truly caring person~ particularly when it ccme.s to
our own people. I would say jn his case,
''action speak louder than words fl when it
comes to the "golden rule" oe "concern"
1.;hen some of us seem to be in tY-ouble or
i1 need of a helping hand. He is genuinely concerned. He cares about people,
friends and farlJ.ilY.

Of concern to hJ.m

also is his own Bear Clan and the Wolf
Clan of his cousins.
Ross says, ' 1 I wish more people

After an introduction to Dora, Eloi~;e
joined us (making it the. four Musketc~ers},
for the next event which 'was at the :enter' s Greek Theatre and featured the Arapaho Children's Theatre from Ft. Washakie, Wyoming. We were entertained b.;
some readings and little skits. Aft~r

the show, we returned to the ballroom for
_9eneral Session II. On the way in, more
familiar faces turned up . We W'rE de·lir,;hted to see Jeanette St. Clair, Ed cation Coordinator for Part A, Title IV,
here in the G. R. Public Schools and C .:mevieve Shirley, Native American Specialist
for the same. After friendly exctiang":"d

of !:he falJ.s and high above them. 1\
beautiful sight to b-chold. And yet, manJ
peopl.e were telling us that the very be.::t.
view of the falls is fr·om the Carc2ai.c.n
side. While it's true that we have a muc~

closer view we are not able to stand bac,<
for an all over view. We decided then,
that before, i,ie left, we'd see the f'all.s
from the other side. We contemplated taking the MAID OF THE MIST a boat which
takes you directly in front of the falls
{for wri:i.ch you have to. get all dresc:.ed up
in waterproof gear), but decided ag::.inst .:.t.

BOO-SHOO!
This is a very short reminder for those who
may have forgotten the most important event
to come our way in quite sometime, a couple
of years to be exact! Because on March
24th and 25th, the Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal
Council will be sponsoring a powwow at the
Aquinas College Fieldhouse in the 1600 block
of East Fulton. So far, we know that there
will be many traders and dancers coming from
as far away as Denver, Colorado and many
from the Great Lakes Region and CAnada. We
want to welcome these Indian people to our
t own of Grand Rapids and show them some of
our own very fine hospitality!!!

MICHIGAN INDIAN CHILD WELFARE AGENCY

* Providing

programs for restructuring
the fragmented family wherever possible.

Aneen!

*

My name is Henry (Tic) Bush Jr. and I
work as a trainee for the Michigan Indian
Child welfare Agency (M.I.C.W.A.). I'd
like to acquaint you, the Native Ainerican
Community, with myself, my job, and the
organization I work for. I want to familiarize you with the programs and services availible through M.I.C.W.A. and
ask for your input so that together we
might work for a better Native American
community.

* Providing

a liason between Native
American families and outside govmental agencies in the child welfare area.

After glancing at the above, it might
look like we are: (a) biting off more
than we can ches, (b) duplicating already existing services, (c) adding to
the confusion of the bureaucrac.,y 1 or

M.I.C.W.A. was initiated in .January of
1978 to provide a Native American community component for the welfare of Na- .
tive American children who are abused,
neglected, or left adrift as a result of
broken homes. Our purpose is to offer
services of crlild welfare closer to the
Native American comn1unity than the distant bureaucracies of the local and
s ':ate governments. Our rational. is this;
t-ie believe that our children are our future; that we as a Nata:vB American community have the prerE:quisites and per~onnel to care for our own.
Indeed, the
Indian Child We} fare Act of 197'7 addresses itself to these issues. We see
M•..~ .C.W.A. as a positive step toward·
self-determination and the management of
our own welfare.

{d ) all of the above.
M. I. C. W. A. E>pecializes in delivering assistance in the child welfare area. It

is not our intent to needlessly duplicate already existing services or infringe on the "turf11 of other agencies.
Our services are largely advisory, and
specifically limited to the Native Ameri.can child welfare area. Our objectives are to provide high quality assistance i.n r.he Indian child_welfare area,
and to monitor those activities that inn uence the well beinz: of the }la r, i ve American child and hi.s family.

The fragmentation of a Native American
f'arnily, for whatever .reasons, have farreaching consequences beyond the per3onal trauma and tragedy of tts individual
family member'::>. The chi.ldren are often
emotionally d~maged, sometimes beyond
repai_r, and their development into mature, u::,eful adults is seriously compromised. The parents are left with
feelJ.ngs of 1oss and dJ.spair, and burdened with the stigma of being hopeless
failures. This in itself is tragic.
But the irreparable damage is suffered
by the Native American community. The
children of these broken hom~~s are often times placed in foster or adoptive
homes far outside the NaUve American
community and its influence. These
Native American foster or adoptive cbi1
children grow up without the knowledge
or familiarity of the Native American
community and often times lose their

M.I.C.W.A. addresses itself to these
&rean:

* Attending

to the needs of Native
. ·American children who are neglected,
abused, or from broken homes.

*

Providing counseling for frag111ented
families.

*

Ass:i.sting in the foster care or adoption process.

* Seeking

out and training Native
American adults who want to be fos ...
ter or adopt.ive parents.

*

Providing programs and preservation
and maintainance of the family unit.

Providing legal assistance in the
child welfare area.

truly symbolize the "vanishing

will cease to exist. This is where
M.I.C.W.A. steps in.
chil~ren

One of the priorities of the M.I.C . W.A.
is to insure the welfare of the Native
American children from a point within the
Native American community. In seeking
out and training foste1~ and adoptive parents, we can be certain that- the Native
American child isn 1 t lost from the community. In.instances where the child is
placed in a non-Indian home, our priorities are to insure that he maintains
contact with the Native American communi ty. We seek to provide counseling to
the parents of the broken homes, to restructure the family so that is remains
a.viable segment of the community. We
also offer information on topics which
include, parenting, emotional development
of children, extended family concepts,
survival and coping skills, self identity
C1Dd the child, and bridging the generat.wn gap, to name a few. Rather than attempting to formulate our own programs in
some of the .above areas, we recognize
that there are already existing programs
in the community. In these instances
our job wi.11 be to match up our client
with the services or programs they need,
and monitor their progress. Thus we see
the importance of a good working relationship with the other agencies within our
community.

As a member of the Native American community in the Grand Rapids acea, I have a
good working relationship and knowledge
of the agencies here. I have also had the
opportunity through various seminars and
training sessions to learn about child
Welfare. My agency has provided me with
excellent training, and I can't help but
be ever mindful of the sensitive and
highly vulnerable quality of the human
dignity of the people I work with. From
t ime to time I hope to contribute articles dealing with some aspect of the

I think you'll agree with me that our
children are ou:.' future, and that their
future is i .n our hands. This year has
been designated as the International
Year of the Child, and I think it's irnperat:lve that we begin to develop a sensitivity to the needs of our cormnunity's
most important commodity; our children.

By Virginia Medacco Herr

We are seriously asking people to send to
us their change of address.

STEVE PARSONS

When the address
the Post Office,
is returned here
five (25¢) cents

Conscientiousness, dedication and enthusiam are all attributes which Steve
Parsons brings into the classroom at the
Indian Adult Learning Center in Lexington School, where he has a very good
rapport with his students.

Steve, who is a good looking six feet
three inches tall, weighs 200 pounds, is
single and looking. Hmmm! In his spare
time he enjoys playing his guitar and
listening to his Beatle records. (He
has every one they ever made.) He also
likes sports and plays some basketball
in his spare time.
rie says his work at the Adult Learning

Center is really enjoyable and his philosophy of life is to, "Live my own life
the best I can."
This fall, he will also be working as the
Coodinator for the Kelloggsville Public
School's Title IV P~gram, and he's really looking forward to it. As for long
range plans, he wants to stay where he
is, but if things should change, he says
he's pretty flexible
And Steve, since you're a Beatle expert,
do you think you could get me an introduction to Geor~e?
{Ed. note: It has been really hard trying to be objective about this tall handsome, honorable, kind,sincere, friendly,
extremely brilliant young man. Wh:y? Because I am his mother.)

change is just left at
the issue of TURTLE TALK
at the cost of twenty
to the Council.

The cost of prin_ting issues of TURTLE
TALK is increasing right along too.
I don't think that with these costs
expanding it wouldn't really be to muc~
to ask you to just send us your new m~il­
ing address 1 • We can't keep on shelling
out coins for returns.

Steve, who was born Stephen Paul Parsons
in Muskegon, Michigan some twenty three
years ago, is of Ottawa heritage and has
been working at Lexington as a teacher
since October 1977.

He holds a B.A. Degree, graduating from
Grand Valley State Colleges in June 1977,
where he majored in History and minored
in Political Science.This spring he will
be taking classes at Michigan State University in Continuing Education, working toward his Masters.

P L E AS E HE L P ! ! !

For if we have to keep doing this we wilJ.
automatically extract your mailing labl e
from our master list and then we will
cancel your issue of TURTLE TALK to you
the ceader. So please, keep this in
consideration. It's not asking much!!!
DO INDIANS STAND A CHANCE WHEN FIGHTING

CITY HALL?
My answer to that question is "Hell No!"
If you think I sound bitter it's because
I'm damn bitter! The just:i.ce our Indian
Elders received from the Grand Rapids
Public Librar>y and from Judge George R.
Cook in the Circuit Court on February 12,
1979 in Grand Rapids was, in my opinion,
no d:i.fferent than Indians received during
the treaty years in the 17 and 1800's.
Our Indian Elders who so graciously consented to take part in the "Native American Oral History Project" were told by the
library, right from the start of the taped
interviews, that the library would copyright each tape in the name of the Elder(s}
who gave the interview. They were also
promised that they would have sole control over how any and all materials taken
from the tapes was used and any and all
materials taken from the tapes would also
be copyrighted in the name of the Elders
involved. Of course these promises were
oral, but nevertheless positive promises.
These promises weren't put into writing
tho\.1'1'.h.until the project was well under
way (February 1976), but as proof that the
promises were made there was a check for
about $270 taken from our very first funding. This check was made out to the lib-

at her coffee.

Heading back toward our hotel, Dora acquired a sudden desire for ice cream (wv
were so relieved when she didn't order
pickles on the side),, so we stopped at
the J.P. Morgan Deli on the mall and
picked up our dessert. Sitting on the
mall benches savoring our goodies, a familiar figure approached us, red hair- flying in the breeze. It turned out to be
Eloise Montpetit, so we invited her to
join us since we hadn't had time for a
really good chat since we'd been here.
Eloise obliged and the four Musketeers,
headed for our room at the St. John
Niagara Hotel, after the ice cream party.
We had some very good conversation. Some
of it serious, and some of it rather
light banter. All in all, it was a very

On the other si.d(:, we i;:;iddUy dropped
on to the park benches that a\rmt ted us,

panti.ng and gtg,gling. Toe benches were
placed all around what looked like a
formal g.::::·'·den at a country e!'Jtate i_n
England. Statuary, fountains, sculptured shubbery and trees. (There were
actually trees with "square 11 tops in
tJ1a t park. ) It was all very (-:'lnchan ting Eke something out of a fair7 tale!

I was back in Canada again. (Just a. week
a.co today I was :Ln Stratford, Ontario
with the teachers and students from the
Lexington Adult Learning Center.) Restedt
...:e set forth once again on our adventure.
Walking along the pat"k 1 Eloise suddenly

blurted out, "I've seen this place in a
dream!" We implored her to tell us more.
"T dreamed about this place, and we came
up or: a restaurant here named FISHERWOJl.1AN
AND FISHERWOMAN 1 S FRIENDS, Inside the
restaurant I was at a table with people warm in atmosphere - and a deep bond between us. 11 F'ascinated,we continued our
walk. Shortly thereafter, we came upon
a restaurant. Eloise shouted, "That's it!"

We looked, but the restaurant was not
called FISHERWOMAN AND FISHERWOMAN 1 S
FRIENDS. "But that's still it, 11 declared
Elotsef Ascending the terrace toward the
restaurant, what should we see, but a
fountain made up of four fish, water
streaming out of their mouths.

No one needed to say anything. Silently,
we all threw a coin into the fountain,
made a wish and continued our journey.
Since our arrival in Niagara Falls, this
one particular thing held our interest.
It could not help but attract our atten-

satH.':f;r r-eady .for ta1;:e oft."

The s&ucer,

\V<.,;··

actually a round revolving restaurant 1
perched atop this long slim 11 necdle 11 and
the base held an amusement park. It looke•
so close" and yet after w'alking blocks
still had blocks to go. (Puff! Puff!)
11

>J•

Finally, arriving at the bottom of the
hill, there stood this thing! We had ce:nqu<::rE;d half our mission.
(The othtH' half
would. be to scale this ht1.J it} After a S·Jf,
ficent rest period 1 we then endeavorEd '.::,:,
climb the hill so that we migtt fins_lly
reach the !>pot where the Skylon stood

:010

"majestically." (Pant! Puff!) Feeli.ng a
b:i..t triumphant, we finally marie it!
Darkness was upon us as we entered a aoor
at the base of this huge structure, Insl.Cle, we found three levels. The first
level housed a merry-go-round with flick-ering lights and many booths w:Lth novelt.ic:
to entertain you, much as you might find ;:,·
a regular amusement park. The next two
levels were more of the same. Catching
Eloise's eye, was a booth wherein Madam
rosa was ensconsed •

Madam Hosa was a fer'"

tune teller.

However, at this point-we were really more interested in find:Lng
place to eat. All that walking had given

<

us big appetites!!! We found a cozy littl•
placE": called the Lady Bug. Eloise ordered

a turkey sandwich and homemade mushroom
soup (wbicb we all sampled and found ck Ucious). Kathy and Dora had roast beef'
sandwiches (with red wine for Do:ra~ naturally) and I had a salami sandwicb. Yunrrny ~
Leaving the Lady Bug rested and happy, ·,,w

explored the base of the Skylon some more,
looking for the place where they take TY<l'

We found it, and decided to all get in tno

A;'ter our picture taking session ( ,Jhich
was more fun than a barre1 of monkeys tee hee) we rejoined Eloise. We ttien
founc'1 ourselves in front of a handwriting
analysis booth, where.we flad our handwriting analyzed. What fun! We also
wanted to go up in that glass elevator
which takes you up 800 feet 1 out.side the
needle, to the top of the Skylon where
the restaurant revolves, but did not
find ·it within our financial means.

Extremely tired, we knew the journey back
was inevitable, and exited the base of the
Skylon at a different level than the one
we came i.n on, so became confused about
directions since the thing is round. We
did not quite know in which direction
to go - at first. Dora and Eloise headed
in the dir•ection they thought was correct,
but these two Ottawa Sisters (Kathy and I)
1-~ne\<1 they were wrong.

We might have been confused at first, but
::oon figured it out and decided to go in
the direction where we heard the roar.

T1e walk on the bridge was exhilaratine,!
Again we were giddy. High on nature's
b<•auty, we laughed, we sang, we joked!

Eloise swears we flew over the bridgebut I don't remember. It could well be!
I remember running into some people from
Australia with thei_r sort of' Cockney Accent. I remember Dora And Eloise lying
down on the International line so that
thei:r heads were in Canada and their
feet were in the U.S. I remember thinking how nice if· this would never end!
Did we sprout wings and soar?'/? I'm not
really sure!
Perhaps we did:;: as we seemed to come down
with a thud at the other end of the br.:..Jge.

Once more we were in the U.S. and stil~
had blocks to go before we woulCl'arrive

OF THE POWWOltl

The powwow is the Indian'.:;; way of expressing visual lndianess. To t he observer this appea
as ~mt.::~rtainment o:c theatr·L:s. The Peligi.ous overt.ones are not apparent and perhaps tr.ts
one reason why U10 U • .S. Governmer:;t. has never tried to stop the powwow. Besides dancing an
!:;1ngj_ng, one of the main purposes of the pO\.<WOli·i is to r enew old friendship::; and for new on
DRUM

The drl1rn is composed not only of the instrument but r..be head singer and a11 other singers
feel they can qualify. Usually an Indian drum is considered 11 open 1; , that is t anyone may c
snd s1.t in who reels qualified or has knowledge of Indian singing. A drum, on occasion, m
be declared a 11 closed 11 drum and only those who have been invi ~ed may ;~~ng. In any case • .L
i~ always proper to ask if one may sit in and the person to approach is usually the head s
er. The importance of this pos.i tlon is to be observed at all tim...;s .

.Indians regard the drum {instument) as the oldest thing he remember::; and it is looked upon
something that has always been with him. The drum is considered to be grandmother and as
ag,:d are to be looked upon with respect and dignity. Tl1ore shall be no profanity around '.::.
drum and no person shall drink alcoholic beverages nor approach the drum if they have been
drinking. Humility is a must. Any per.son who sits at the drum must feel :i.n his heart tha
l1c is no better than any other person sitting around him.

DANCE ARENA
Dance arenas can be any open ground large enoueh to comfortable accomodate all the partici·
pants and observers . The audience or observers may sit on lawn chai r s or bleachers if pro·
videti, but must not sit on the benches pcovtdE~d for the dancers . Befoce any activities ha.;
started, the dance <:trena has been "consecrated" for the duration of the powwow and organiz
actl vi ties, including games foi~ the children, may be conducted within the dance arena.

1

It is the job of the Arena Director to see that all dancers are comfortable and that the
s:Lngers and dancers have water and that their needs are fille d . He also has to obligation
of maintaining the sanctity of the arena durj_ng the powwow period. He keeps the audience
informed of the activities of the day.
GIVE~AWAYS

OR SPECIALS

The giving of presents is a method of honoring individua1s or groups among the I ndian peop:
The recognition is more important than the materlal value of the gift . The reasons for h:::'
ing a give-away are many and varied. The process uGually requires a considerable amount c
t1me and can become somewhat boring to an audience . The give-away is an extremely importa1
part of being Indian, and the entertainment of an audience is always secondary, therefore,
a special or give-away must take priority over the wishes of an audtence. The honoring of
friends and relatives is a very prominent part of the powwow and proper dtgnity must be ma:
tained. As always, there are certain procedures which must be followed fol' both partici.pai
and observers. When the song is sung and tne dance begins, observance must be maintained <
to the leaders (a dancer must not infringe c,n the lineup of the leaders by puslaing in or
d:mc:ing p2st the le&ders. ) The song is danced around the drum during the "tal.J. 0 of the soi

Pro~ram pr·oved once again to be a successful combination.

Thirty-seven students and preschoolers

his small home at one time, to tide them overt

..,t~eprinted from WASSAJA 1 Jan/Feb '79
A nmv law enacted by the U.S . Congress late in
1978 has been hailed as a. progres::.ivE~ step by

Indian leaders and tribes. The act concerns
Indian child welfare and attempts to correct
a serious situation in wh:i.cb Indian child:cen
are placed in foster home.s where the parents
are non-In<hans, despite the fact that the
tribes and the relatives of that child want. 5..t
to be placed 1-Ji th Indian sponsocs.

So many illegal and unethical incidents have
occured that many states have a regular business going :i.n which non-Indian parents are
vying for adoption of an Indian child. Other
i.ncidents that have been reported include the
forc.i.ble "adoption" of an Indi.an child by nonIndian parents 1 with t.he help and convenience

of social welfare authorities.
After a long time of lobbying for the bill,
the act was finally passed and it is now hoped
that the illegal situation will be corrected.
However, it was not publicized, nor was l. t

made known until former Senator James Abourezk
r..:ductantly announced it, that the Mormon
Gnurch was exef'!Pted from t.be provisions of the
Indi.an Childre Welfare Act,
We exempted it on purpos(~ and
out of necessity. There would have been one
hell of a political fight if we hadn't." The

Said Abourezk :

11

statement was reported in the New York Times
and repeated in Vince Lovett Is !'!_ewsnotes' em-~
anating from the BIA in Washington, D.C.

The pain suffered by the Indian families either d.irect1y or indirectly involved in the ffohir.g

Indian people have had to suffer in almost total silence because the suffering prompted by r ·

their friends and relatives.
Student recognition was conducted with each

The night was something that most of the stud~nts will never forget, and I think the teachers deserve a big hand of applause!
There was guest speakers from the House of

Tuesday, May 8, 1979
By

Dave Burhenn

In a landmark ruling, U.S •. Chief District Judge Noel P.
fox has told the state of Michigan it has no power to
regulate fishing in vast stretches of the Great Lakes
by two bands of Indians.

The ruling opens parts of the lakes to non-state-controlled commercial fjshing by members of the Bay Mills
Indian Community and the Sault Ste. Marie band of Chippewa Indians.
The judge issued his decision Tuesday in the hi.storic
Indian fishing rights case. In a 131-page opinion, Fox
ruled that the state Department of Natural Resources
(DNR) has no authority to control commercial or subsistence fishing by Indians.

Their Fishing rights, the judge ruled, are quaranteed
by treaty and cannot be curtajled.
The LinJ tee! States :i.nlt:;nded that the Michigan Indians
be able to fish in ordt'r to maintain the1r l.i vel.:ihood

Severa l weeks of trial were held last year on the lawsuit, during which historians offered C•)n' U.ctlng interpretations of the bach:ground and fl.avor of 191:.h-century tr.eaty negotiations w1th
U1e Ind l ans.

Jn his opJnion, fox came down clearly on the side of tLe trtbes ruling that they had not si9ned
lway their 12,000-year-old practice of fishing in the Creat Lakes.
f o;;; wrote, ".,.simple just.i.ce requires that thi:.> court be9iri to put an end to the unfa.i rnes s

fS;2 be.tween Great Britain and the United State!>, and the 1reaty of 1836, which ceded lndi.ln
L.mds to the inf ant state of Michigan.
T!lt.:: Judge wrote that in the Treaty of Ghentj the United States agreed to protect the rights of

tndians who had been the allies of Britain during the war.
ln the Treaty of 1836, Fox r·uled, Indians never gave aw.ay their 11 aborigina.l" right to fish J.n
t:he lakes adjacent to the ceded lands. The judge al.so stated th;lt treaty must be interpreted :w
a light favorable to the J~dians.

r nx found that in the 19th-century Indians' lim:\ted under.standlng of the terms of the 1836
tnMty , they could hunt and fish "as long as the sun rose and the waters flowed."
state had claimed Jn its defense that another treatyr signed in 1855, took away the fisning
privileges. Fox wrote that the pact did nothinq of the kind. "The United States could no t be
.:·!':leased from a right originating in the Indians which Jt never owned and could never give,"
the opinion stated.

The comment by U.S. Rep. Robert Davis, A-Gaylord, about the Indi<rns' "proven record of explo1 tation 11 indicates a rather- abbreviated sense of history. Next, we'll be hearing that the Indi.1ns

Have no fear! The saga of Niagara Falls wi.11
continue! (This is for those of you who thought I'd dropped the whole mattm' when we
skipped an installment in last month's issue.)
Due t.o lack of space, we had to forego an in;stallment, but rest assured, we will carry on
from here. We had no intention of leaving you

get a couple inquiries · : to why it was n<it in

poor driver know that most of us were as nervous about the prospect as he was. Not Dora
though! True to her word, she gave him a great
big "smackern when we got there. The rest of
us were lacking in courage 1 much to his relief,

I'm sure.

seated ourselved in the hall and nibbled away
at our "lunch" which consisted of stale crack~··

of our old and new found friends. Bye and bye
our bus arrived. We boardedj and was soon
heading south to Buffalo. The day was lovely
and as we left the d.ty, we could see the mist

It didn't take friendly outgoing Dora long to
make a new friend at the terminal. Before long
she was introducing Kathy and I to Morry One

North Dakota, and the four of us were soon
headed for the lounge to help us "kill" the

Eloise Montpetit

On Thursday and Friday (May 10th and 11th),
Shirley McDonald, Jean Warren and I {Eloise) ,
went to Detroit for an Outreach Training Wot'k.1hop sponsored by the Detroit Indian Center.
We were on the road, sleepy-eyed and yawning
at 4:45 A.M. Thursday. After a time of rid-

ing through the pre-dawn darkness, I was
lulled to sleep by the movement of the car
and the songs from the radio . I awakened in
full sunlight to find that we were parked in
? gas station lot, trying to figure out how to
get to the Hotel Ponchartrain where we were to
be staying.

"Where are we?" I asked.
We 1 re in Detroit! 11 r,horused Shirley and Jean.

'1

the question was where in Detroit, and ~
to get to th<:: destined hotel. After much
skillful maneurvering on the part of our driver, Jean Warrer., through the streets of doW11·town Detroit, and many mistaken turns later,
Jean looked up and said, "There it is!" And
ther" was the Hotel Ponchartra:Ln.

c got on with the other business of outreach
and over the two day period we were
·taught methods to enable us to be more effecient and humanistic outreach administrators.
Role-playing was done by members in the group
where one person was the "client" and the
other, the worker. Professional criticisms
were offered by the two consultants in attendance and group criticism was encouraged. We
were able to organize outreach services and
community resources so as to document for ourselves and future outreach workers the systematic methods of performing outreach work.
~raining,

Also present at this conference were two people from Michigan State University who are
responsible for devising those blue forms with
all the questions you are asked to fill out
when you come into the center for assistance .
The purpose of filling out these unpopular
forms is to determine the needs wit~i~ our communicy so that we can plan for providing better
services and adequately meet all our needs.
We attended a total of sixteen hours intensive
training within the two days, with much participation on our parts to contribute to the
"group dynamic."
I'd like also to mention the hospitality given
·to us and other visitors by the Detroit American Indian Center, who served us food at their
Detroit center on Thursday evening and provided
us with a mini pow wow. They took care to see
that our room reservations were satisfactory,
provided transportation with their cars and
van, and generally helped to make us feel welc6me in their city.
l\fter the conclusion of Friday's workshops,
Jean, Shirley and I, along with some women
from the Cleveland Center, toured Detroit.
Six of' us women could be seen taking in the
mid-afternoon sights of Detroit. Friendships,
a s Jerome Warcloud asked in prayer earlier in
the conference, were strengthened. We arrived back at the hotel to find Jerome patiently
waiting for his staff to return. After saying
our goodbyes, the Cleveland people piled into
Jerome's Cherokee Chief vehicle ; Grand Rapid~>
into Jean's car, and after a final wave thrOl.u
the windows, we returned to our cities.

We hope that what we learned throughout this
conference will help us to work with you in
the quality ways which you deserve when you
enter the Council for outreach se rvi ces .

Mee-gwetch,
Eloise Montpetit

It has been a good many years since I drop;v:. •.
out of Ravenna High School in Ravenna, Mich-·
igan and I suppose at that time, I didn't rea-·
lize the importance of a high school diploma.
Since then, I h.ave come to realize that i t is
'f.~!'l. important indeed, and not .only a_hi~
school diploma, but a college degree is a .....~
most essential if' one is to survive comfortably in this world.
After my divorce, I was pushed out of the

nest like a baby bird that does not knoi.; hrn,,
to fly . Survival was the name of the game
and I almost didn't! Having no working s kil.i ::.
or experience, I soon realized that dropping
out of high school so many years ago, was not
one of my ;.riser decisions.

I started taking classes through Wyoming .,c\1.roun:i ty Education and finally finished here 2 ;,
the Indian Adult Learning Center and a.m p.r o'Jd
to say that I will finally have my high e cho, ·l
diploma. I am happy too, that my 17 yeard 0 ' ,!
son Tom(who dropped out like 11is motner I, ab .;
finished at the Lexington Adul 'c Learning Cent, e t'
and so -we- will graduate together.
The classroom situation at the Learning Cen ~e ...,
was most unique tn that my oldest son ( <Wd
Tom's older brother) Steve Pa.:csons,(who had
tne wisdom and foresight to finish not or,1.y
high school but college as well},was one of
our tea.chers at Lexington. It was a gre;:<t l' Xperience for all three of us.

has been renewed. Among other items Mr.

Boo-shoo!
With the resignation of Toni Foster in May, it
was I who "inherited 11 her old title, being next
in succession to the "throne, 11 and with that
"authority" immediately appointed Ross Morgan
Assistant Editor.

We shall try our very best (following in Toni's
moccasins}, to continue to keep you informed •.
Kay Compos has been a great deal of help to me,
as has Matthew Medawis, who unfortunately for .
us, is no longer with us at the Council. We
are using a drawing of Matthew's, on the back
of our current issue of TURTLE TALK, and it
is a reduction of the poster he did for Festival's "Several Nations" poetry reading, which
Eloise goes into further is this issue. Matthew
is a very talented artist, as you'll probably
remember from last month's cover of TURTLE
TALK. Thank you for all the help, Matthew,
however brief.

INTRODUCING •••••••

KAY COMPOS
By Virginia Medacco Herr

Even though she only started working as a rec eptionist at the Indian Adult Learning Center
a t Lexington School in January of this year,
soft spoken even tempered Kay Compos is not
new to the area. She has been around this way
before, working at the Council from 1973
through 1977t first ·as a receptionist and t hen
as a book keeper. Ambitious Kay has also been
attending Grand Valley State Colleges for t wo
and a half years and before that, spent a year
at Junior College. When finished with her
schooling, Kay wants to go into social work,
working with young Indian children.
A surprising discovery recently made by Kay is
that she . is a Potawatomi. You see, Kay always
"thought" she was an Ottawa.
Formerly Kay Shaganaby, she is now single (sort
of), and is the mother of pretty and precocious
Isabel, who is nine years old.
Being out in the woods by the lake, pow wows,
and ~usic makes Kay happy. She also enjoys
playing the guitar.
Rather quiet' for a Gemini, there is a side to
her which she says she always keeps to herself.
And her philosophy for living? 11 If lt feels
good, and doesn't hurt anybody else, go ahead
and do it!" Sounds interesting, Kay.

stripped of their lane, religion and cul. ture,
our people have desperately held on to t~e
idea that one day they would again walk in

peace, live in th• teachings of our anoe•tora,
and choose to work-to play-to be Indian. Long
have they been misunderstood, these the sole
inheritors of this great country, satisfied
with a.l l that Mother Earth had bestowed upon
them, able to live in a harmony known only to
a few, wealthy beyond the wildest dre&lll.!I of

lHl CALL

I was watching the woods one day, when
I heard a mournful cry.
I asked my Mother Earth if it was she,
but !lhe said no.
I walked pn. and I heard it once more.
So sad that it would break your heart.
I asked t he brook if it was he,
and he sai d yes it was.
I asked what could make him so very , sad.
He said my brother s don't come to drlnk
from me anymore,
The beast of the woods ·won't .drink from me,
and my water i s no longer clear as glass,
and sweet as honey.
·
My water don't look as it once did, my
banks are muddy, and no tree~ will grow
by me anymore.
Strong men come arid dump things in my
water t o make me sick, and whoev.er_
drinks of me.
How I wish, I was in the days when my
brothers were young, then I could be
free once more to run to my mother the sea.
But t hose days are gone, and so is the
life that used to come ·to me for ••• life.

NATIVE AMERICAN EDUCATION PROGRAM
The school year has come to a close.
I t is good to look back to a year that
had p~ogr£ms and activities that invo l ved children and parents. It was
good working with all of you and a big
thank you go~s out to you for all the
invlovement and 6~operation you gave.
There is one regret, however, and that
is the Native American tducation Program could not affer a summer program
f or its students this year. There was
a cut in this year's grant so it was
not possible to make plans as we did
~th er summers.
A number of programs
~0 take place in this area.
You, perha ps would like to take advantage of
wh at is being offered. Do give us a

INDIAN HEALTH TRENDS NOTED
The department of Health, Educati o n,
and Welfare Indian Health Servic e ha \
published a report on Indian health
trends and services. The repnrt indicates that the death rate for American Indian infants was 71% lower .
in 1975 than it was in 1955. During
th.is same period, deaths due to g a s troenteric causes declined by 88% and
that deaths from influenza and pneu - '
monia were reduced by 63%.
Despite this progress, however, th e
report shows that the health statu s
of American Indians and Alaska Nativ e5
continues to lag behind that of th e
general population. Particularly pr~­
valent is alcoholism and death an d injury from accidents.
Individual copies of "Indian-'Hea Jth
Trends and Services" are available

POETRY
THE TRAIL OF NO RETURN
(Incarnation of Yellow Hawk.)
Wh.Ue walking through the woods one day,
A strange sight I did see
I came upon a well worn path,
Which wasn't meant for me
Should I pursue this hidden trail?
Just where would it lead?
My heart beat faster at the thought,
Of mystery and intrigue.
The thought became enticing,
Had I a lesson to be learned?
And step by step I started,
Down the trail of no return.

I followed it a

Br.ight fires burned by tall tee pees,
Childre·n laughed·\ in glee,
Woman dressed in buckskin dresses, 1
fringed around the knees
They had a quiet dignity,
Like I had never seen,

Who were the people living here?
I asked what can this mean?
I felt I was intruding in a pdvate
family here,

I tried to turn,
Retrace my steps,
But some force held me here.
These people and this village,
Seemed more like home to me,
Are those my parents sitting there?
I watched so silently.
In thl.s life I lived before,

I came to earth again,
I felt so peaceful and content,
Something held me then.
The Great Chief came from out the darkness,
Which had fallen now;
A sadness settled on the village,
The drum beat soft and low

He spoke " Hark! People hear me,
My heart is sad and torn,
My son was ta:..:en from our. village
Never to return. 11

1r1-1e left our village, food to seek
The elk and deer to stalk:
He cared not for the danger,
He was mig!1ty Yellow Hawk.

He found his prey and aimed his arrow,
Then a rifle cracked,
The valiant Yellow Hawk went down,

A bullet in his back,"

The. white man laughed~. and tauntedJ

'That 1 s another one for me, ·

We got the gallant Yellow Hawk,

And as his blood spilled on the ground.

And knew his brave~y,

I feel a certain sense of loss myself .Still,
I did know Mouz - in spirit! I knew of his

I've seen him at all the pow wows and other

MY MICHIGAN ISLAND
I ran along the sunlight sand,
W:.i. nd blowing through my hair,
WhJte waves washed upon the shore,
Wi th sea gulls calling near,

l stopped to choose a stone or two,
lo t oss into the sea,
And t hen I stQpped in wonderment,
For all the world to see,
As all the beauty I beheld,
Was hard to comprehend,
r t ried to hold it still in time,
f 111 I return again.

Return I must,
I have a fervent longing for the sea,
The sun, the sand, the wind,
fhc waves,

Nature's calling me.
l have this yearning which is
sometimes hard to understand,
What draws me to this special place?
Along the sea and sand?
Perhaps in life before I've . lived,
My life along the sea,
And gathered shells and stones,
h.?1d fi shed with fam-i-ly.
fo quell the longing in my soul,
J mu st return again,
t:..nd f eel the wind blow through my hair,
Jlt.y bare Feet in the sand.

the softness,
or the gentle sea,
·ro watch t he sunset softly glow,
With peace engulfing me.

- DOROTHY MEDACCO
A$ a child, which to me seems,
\ges and ages ago,
r we:.~; always drawn t o this place,
Sur.rounded
~y wnat to me was the biggest
pine t r ees in my small world,
.\nd ~ he little creek that ran,
Sw1ft~ y by the bank ,
'Jn which t he trees stood,
1 always felt like I belonged there,
Or had been there before,

Sitting quietly alone,
Letting ~y imagination wander,
Whereever it cared to roam,
And listening as the wind blows
through the trees,
I lay on the bed of moss,

And hear the tales,
The aged pines had to tell,
Of the old days,
.
When they were many and so
very much younger,
ot the many children,
Running and playing,
Crying beneath their outstreatched arms,
It made no difference,
If they were the color of Autumn, brown,
Or the color of the snows,
That cling so heavily to their branches,
Or ••

the color of cornsilk,
Upon ripe corn,
It matters not to the majestic pine,
For they know,
We are all of one being,
And the Great Spirit,
In all wisdom,
Made us so.

- NES-WA-BIN
THE OLD WAY
It was time for the Sun,
To come over the mountains,
A Bi:-'1-ve and hls woman,
Got up from a peaceful night's sleep,
He went down to the river,
To clean his body,
So he could be pure,
And talk to the Great Spirit,
To start his day as it should be done,
· He took his plpe and tobaccos·~
For an offering,
To.the four· Powers of the Earth,
When all was done as it should be don~,
He went back to his tepee and ,
ate the good food,
· his woman had cooked for him,
He then sat back forawhile,
He looked out to see the vast land before him :
He could see,
The deer, fox, and birds,
Hunting for thier food,
He also saw q,..large herd of Bison.
He watched, ..... ".
As two bulls Joustedt
Over a ycund cow,
His heart feld good,

Becau::;e he was at pea.ce,
With his Mother the Earth,
He could talk,
W•th all the Spirits of the land,
When he felt trouble in his heart,
Gr in mind,
He could talk to the Spirits,
And find peace,
Wl thin himself.
fhcn one day,
He became lost,
lost to all,
That had been lost,
To all th-at was to come,
When he was troubled,
There was no one to talk to,
The Spirits,
Would not listen to him anymore,
Because he was,
No longer pure,
What has happened?
To this .once noble breed of people:?
They are still here,
Walking the Earth,
All tl1ey ne.ed to do,
Is open their hearts,
minds, and souls,
to the people of the old way •••
to the people they once were •••
in the days ••• gone •••
past.

LEGEND OF THE ROADRONNER

One day when the Indians returned from the
hunt} they discovered their fire had died
down; only the gray ashes remained. .The
Indians prevailed upon Roadrunner to rw1
to Lightning-God, keeper of the Fire, and
ask him for ,one of his fire-sticks.
·
Ro.adrunner, being a good fellow, agreed
and started at once for the mountain home
of Lightning-God. His strong legs helped
him to "fold up the earth" (make good
time); soon he reached his destination.

"What brings you here?" asked LightningGod.
11

The Indians badly need fire."

t1No! 11

Lightning-(.lod angrily retorted.

Roadrunner realized it was useless to ask
again, so the first chance he had, he
snatched one of the fire-sticks from the
blazing fire. Hastily placing it across
his back and curling his tail over it, \o,~
scampered away. Lightning-'1od grabbed some
flaming arrows and began shooting at Roadrunner saw an arroyo and scurried into it,
escaping the arrows. But the beautiful
plu.'T!eS on his head were burnt 'off, leaving
only 2 small tuft. His back was singed
so trra.t it became a brownish color, and his
eyes turned red fr·om the smoke he endured.
Roadrunner .successfully brought the fire.stick to the Indians. When the women saw
bis tired red eyes and his short, stiff
bushy head they lougly wailed, "Shoik,
Shoik, Shoik 11 (Poor Bird). Roadrunner was
touched by their display of love and wail ed,
"Poi, Poi, Poi."
Ever since then the Roadrunner

h~·.c: :-·:ir1·" i,:,

hpme _in t.tle chaparral. Whenever he finds
a fat lizard he cheerfully chants, 11 Thra v
Thr'at' Thra! 11 When the Indians hear tis
chant they smile grateftflly.remembering
what~.Roadrunner did for them.

I wish to sign my young cousin (Chippewa &
Ottawa blood) for the TURTLE TALK magazine
and wish to enter $2.50 for M:m, also $2.50
for myself. Check is enclosed.

While in college, I was told that the two
major minority groups that are.repressed in
Grand Rapids are the Indians and the Blacks .
I gave this statement some thought. The
first thought that came into my mind ·was
"How crude!" The next was what could I do
·or say about this matter. (I am a" Native

Ame;rican.)

Well, this is what I think! Wt;ty should I
patfonize any merchant who shows signs of

How many other repressed minorities feel
this way?

There is always a feeling of joy and
gratefulness in me on pow wow grounds
to see all the people gather · in one
spirit. Two strong drums were present
and there were many traditional and
fancy dancers. I had the privilege
of meeting two elders of the Six
Nations peoplei from Syracuse, New
York. Mrs. Sundown talked deeply and
candidly •bout the problems that some
. of the young people are having with
substance abuse, and th~ 'talks she
gives to these young people to remind
them of who they are and : ~o encourage
them to begin the·, searc~tt..Or thelr pur ··
pose in life. - She says· tfiere are many
people on her reservation who are
strong and healthy and living· tradition- .
ally. I enj-0yed being in the company
of our own elders who always have so
m~oh to share and are good to listen
to.

INDIAN .

..

Bv SAM D.JsH
The two most common questions I am asked in
our community today are; "Atte·· you Indian, or
are you traditional Indian?" I f eel being
Potawatomi Indian, it's my .responsibility to
have knowledge of these questions. ·
"Being Indian" to me means being born to an
Indian parent. I can't understand how .. a
person can be "Indian'! without having any .
ancest~al blood in them • . So to me, just
anyone can't have the privilege to sh~re in
the inju$tice, stereotype, pride and all
other things which we "Indians" share and
experience.
"Are you traditional Indian?" I find this
question more difficult to answ~r. Trad~
ition means practicing your culture. (Having been .handed down from generation to
generation.) Or further, how ! ·understand
being traditional, means having spiritual
beliefs. Spiritual to me, means living the
truth of life, which.shouldn't -be confused
with religion, which. I understand means
living the church.

Boo-shoo!
She has done it again, h3~n 1 t shc~? I didn't think anything could compare to
this past Autumn's magnJ. f.icer-~; dis.play 1 but: never have I seen such breathtaking
beauty as the fairyland scene that our Mother Earth put on, Christmas eve and
Christmas day. Beautiful rrostrci bushe~ and trees with intricate lacy branches
and trees emerging from the 1'\1gqy mi.st all over the snowless but frosty countryslde was a sight incomparable to any l have ever beheld before.

The Christmas tr lp to Mi.iskegon, had ever y(·ne "oohing" and "ahing" over each
new and beautiful sight and l'1 earjer. aiit.ic1 pation over what new thing of beauty
would greet our eyes just 2tr!.' t1nd che ""C!"ne • We were not disappointed. We drifted

through a frosty misty make-be .i~v~ wonderland all the way to Muskegon. And
Christmas for our family wa6 i'inothe::: memo:r.table occasion. Hope each and everyone
of you had a good Christmus tco.

The new year is well umh·r''i<'i l' no·.v a.nd I hope none of us is f'aced with any
insurmountable obstacles. Yi"t'r t.~(1~.tOJL' L~; presently without an automobile and
finding the situi.ition rathe1 <h:rficu1c, but I shall remain undaunted. For the
first time in many moons I a1'TI experl~nei1 n what it is like for other people wl thout "wheels." Perhaps th.ls H 1:;tle; "hardship" is godd tor me.
Want to remind everyone ab·'.:>..rt thie ;:1ders lunches which are served at. Lexington
School every Monday and W~dnesday at noon. If you are 50 years old and over, there
is no charge. For all others, the cost is $2.00. I understand they have very good
food. So why not try it some ti.me? (Your editor has yet to try these lunches, but
I'll get there soon~ I promise.}
Also wanted to once again thank Richard Hyatt for Qur cover. Don't know what
we'd do without all the fine ar.ticts around the community. One of them always
comes through for .us. Thanks aga.ln, R1ch. Hope you all enjoy this issue. ·See
you next month.

********************************ii'*********************************************
December 31, 1979
·
From:

Joe John,· .Unit 4 ·

Northern M.i.chiqan Ottawa Association
To whom· it will concern:
On

March 28, 1836 the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan signed

a treaty with

the

government fo the United s.tates turning over 13~536,449

· acres of Michigan land. The Indians received payment ranging from one-half
Qent to £ifteen cents per acre for this land~ prices that were well below
· the going rate at that time. 'r'his 13 million acre area included all of
'~estern Michigan north of a line from Grand Haven to Lowell and west of a
line-from Lowell to Alpena. It also included the .eG'lstern one-half of the
Upper Peninsula.
In 1946, Congress passed the In.dianClaims Act .to handle cases for
Indians who had not received adequate payment for their land. In 1948,
_Robert and Wanetta Do~inic of the Northern Michigan O~tawa Association,
initiated a claim for the , Ottawa ·and Chippewa Indians for reimburs,e ment at .
.1~.

a rate of $1. 25 per acre. 11.'hrough lengthy negotiations ·over the next 25 · .
years, a settlement was reached in 1972 for compen$"1tion ·at a rate·· of ninety
cents per acre. This money is now being held in trust, accumulating interest,
.which makes the total setUe:ment appr.oxirn<).tely $15 million by ·the end of 1979.

a

Negotiations are currently underway to estahlish
distributfon plan
for this settlement. It is likely that the fon:nul~ will be the same or very ·
similar to that used in the settlement with the Grand River Band of Ottawa
for the Treaty of 1821. That settlement was based on the Annuity Payroll of
1911. In an 1870 :roll, and the 1908 Durant Roll, over ·a,ooo Michi.gan Ottawa
and Chippewa who were one-half Indian or mor.e were listed. However. after
careful screening to elminate those enr olled with other tribes and those
who were not one-half Ottawa or Chippewa;. and· markin'\J them on the 1908 Durant
Rc?ll with red and blue che ck marks, 5,644 Ottawa and Chippewa qua:fified for
the 1911 annuity payment.
The current settlement will be distributed equally to descendants ·of
members. of the Grand River, Grand Trave rse, Little ·r:raverse,

Sault Saint Marie

Ba.~ds

Mac~inac

and

that were parties to the 1836 treaty.

Mrs. Wanetta Dominic, who ·chai.rs the 1821 and the 1$36 descendant's .

committees has been doing certification work for the Ottawa and Chippewa
Indians of lower Michigan sin'c e the ear;ly 1960's whenever it was required
for education, health and employment purposes.

It has been awhile since:you have heard
·from us but we are still around working in
assigned schools.

i·

.

The OJT .Program is presently at a very slow
pace - .almost at a standstill, due to the economy and the situation it is now in. The
work field is down to near zero, W.ith very
Httle work force. ·we have made quite a few
contacts with local employers this past
month (January), and find that they are not
doing too much right now, Ih fact most employers a.re laying off their own employees,
and don't expect to get back to work, or do
any hiring until the spring of this year.
Almost every employer has. stated that they
would be glad to participate in the OJT Program and contract with us when the economy
world picks up. In the meantime we will
keep trying and hope for· some openings somewhere.

Due to

The purpose being to identify Native American

Huron Potawatomi
Athens Indian Reservation
Fulton, MI 49052

On January 5, 1980, the ranks of our
Potawatomi nation were thinned by the passing of our brother John Chivis Sr. Services
for John were held Tuesday, January 8, 1980
at Vanderpool Funeral Parlor in Grand Rapids.
During the latter part of John's life, he
gave much of his time for others. This will
dlways be remembered and appreciated by fellow tribespeople. _
One of the ways he served was being a member
and treasurer of the Council. The faithful
and persistent efforts he invested in this
position will be greatly missed by all.
.

'

Mr . Chivis served as Pastor of an Indian
Church in Grand Rapids. It is of commendable achievement that he could find the time
he did to devote to the needs of the tribe.
Those. who will feel the loss the most will
be John's family. Heartfelt sympathies are
extended on .their behalf.

Dear Turtle Talk:
Smile, someone loves you! This is the way
I feel as I leave Crand Rapids to go .into
training for my future job as counselor for
American Indians, may they be adolesence,
young married or senior cit:lzens.
I have hopes of attaining other degrees in
college but my first and only desire is to
help some one with a problem which they may
think isn't easy to solve.

As I go in this new home, people and sounds, Payments for minors are being held in trust by
I go with a good feeling because I have

reinvt~sted to earn the best interest rate ..

payment was made: 40 payments for persons now
The risk one must accept
deceased will be made to their heirs after
The risk one can afford to take

The risk one cannot afford to take
The risk one cannot afford not to take

congratulations from the Bureau of .Indian

Not that I haven't loved or cared for each
family; and each of my children. They understand my need to live my life as I see
fit - not as a mother only.

Bob and Waneta Dominic are the main reason

family- .and friends are'. proud of c ~he s~ccess
changing my life. I'll continue to learn
they· have achieved.
from others· and my most exciting thing to

My spiritual satisfaction will come as I

Everyone had.a good ·time during the days
activities, visiting, cheering for their
teams and especially chowing down. Some
of us ate too much fry bread and had a
time bowling when we got back to Grand
Rapids that night. But all in all it
was exciting. It's good to see our
Indian pebple gathering together and participating in these sort of activities.
It makes for great fellowship with each
other, and gives everyone a chance to
visit With those we don't see very often.
This is the way I like to see our people
get along - not feuding with each other,
or holding g,udges against their blood
brother. It does sbmething to the heart
which made me feel good to

be able to bd there ahd wifness such a
day of fellowship and enjoy myself with
the rest of the peo~le. (I had to qh~er
for two teams cause I had brothers on
one·team and tlncl~s and cou~ins on.the
other.)

1he Iridian Basketball Tournament held
ln Mt. Pleasant at their Tribal Cente~
Gym, on Feb. 9, 1980 turned out to be'
quite a success and a fun day for
everyone that participated. It was
also exciting for those of us who wer•
there to watch.
·

The next ga~e of Indian fellowship will
be will be the Bowling tournament which
will be posted a~ to the times and dates~
There's jus~ o~e thing about the gym
that I missed, and that was a place to
sit, for the spectators and visitors.
Get busy yot.1 young men- ana ladies, and

there were four Indian
teams that took part in the games,they
were: Lansing, Traverse City, Grand

Mt. Pleasant defeated Grand Rapids and One Who Enjoyed Herself,
Traverse City. In the final play-off, A Cheerleader and Specataor,
Lansing defeated Mt. Pleasant and were SHIRLEY A. (Sprague) Chamberlain
the champions with a total of three
wins. Mt. Pleasant came In second
place wiLh a total of two wins. Grand
Rapids took third place and Traverse
City came in fourth. They all did a
good job playing. and did their best.

There also were good things to eat for
all of the players and visitors thanks
to young ladies of the reservation and
the famous "fry bread" makert Eleanor
Sprague. She did a good job of whipping up some Indian bread, golden brown
in that real hot me-da, and at such
great speed.

Peshawbestown who passed away recently. There
is more on Hr. Sand in neighbQring article.

Until about three y~ars ago, Duhamel said his
uncle had never been to a doctor, apparently
enjoying perfect health until these last few
yeJrs.
One of the youngest of 16 sons and two
daughters, Geboo worked in area logging camps
,:;ind on a commercial fishing tug as a young man.
He operated a steam engine in the once thriving
Suttons Bay sawmill then later in the Kllway
sQwmlll, retir~ng at age 70.
When questioned about the fishing rights dispute of recent years, Geooo said once he
couldn't understand it. "I used to look around the sky, the waters and the woods and I
thought they belonged to God. Now I guess
they belong to the DNR, ti he chuckled.

On a happier note we'd like to send our.our
congratulations to William (Bones) Fox and
Joann Leaureaux who tfed the knot on Feb 15th
_1980. Much happiness to you two.

If THERE IS A MISTAKE IN THIS NEWSLETTER, CONSIDER IT PUT THERE FOR A

Alifelong resident of Leelanau County, he was

lovely cover this month was done in invisible

you'll be able to see it. And now to get on

As you've probably noticed above, you now
have a new editor. It is with heavy heart
and much regret that this will be my last
TURKEY TAU<. I have truly enjoyed putting
i t out, but I am leaving because I am overwhemled with much emotion.
You see, your editor finally got a raise
aft er working here two and a half years.
Her salary has gone up from $3.67 per hour
t0 $5.00 per (just like her peers). Those
in power felt sorry for your editor, since

I am grateful to the .Council for taking me
under its wing when 1 was down and out - divorced, a high school drop out and two children at home. After coming here, I managed to
get my high school diploma and even had one
class at Junior College. It has been an experience working here . There have been some
good times and I've met a lot of interesting
people. It has also helped me be more in
touch with my "roots." I am an Indian and my
lndian-ness will always be with me. Still~ am an individual who will not be stereotyped. I .am MEI I will always be me. I
pride my~elf on my individuality. To some, I
must appear a complex person - ~ a paradox. But

TURTLE TAU< NEWS ITEM

CETA III PROGRAM:
On March 11 & 12, we attended a

Works~op

in

Indianapolis~

Indiana regarding a new Tracking System·, with new forms

to be used in the CETA III Programs. This Tracking system
was introduced to us by the Federal RepresentatJv~s from
Washington O.C., Mr. Willard Lambert and Mr. Joe Meadows •.
It is designed to aide in a better, more accurate. filing
system on all participants of the CETA programs.
We feel the system is a good one and will benefit the
Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal Council in possibly their total
filing system of all programs administered thru the InterTribal office.

The Workshop turned out very well with Native American
sponsors from Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, the
Region 5 area. We had an enjoyable time and met some very
nice people from these other areas. The weather was cool ,
and our flight was a little rocky on our way over, but
other than that everything went well while we were there~
But, of <:0urse things were different on our journey back
to Grand Rapids. Our flight from Indian<lpolis was an hour
late in taking off 1 which also made us miss our transfer
flight out of Detroit. This put us behind another hour.
We were lucky to get another flight out the same night
or we would have been in Detroit overnight. The waiting
was tirf.ng and frustrating, but we f.inally landed at the
Kent County Airport about 8 PM, two hours later than
scheduled. Then we waited patiently at the airport for

a ride home.

All this .made the trip memorable to us

and also tested our patience.
Thanks to Roger for taking us out to the Airport on
Monday at noont and for sending his chauf~ered limo out to
pick us up Wednesday night when we arrived.
Me-gwetch Uncle!
Also a personal thanks to Roger & Rita for keeping my
daughter for me while I was gone on this trip.
A double Me-gwetch!

was the hunter Gosadaya. Gosadaya went deep
into the forest hunting and, after walking
fur three days~ Gosadaya stopped and made a
&ial l lodge for himself to stay in. Gosadaya
.riade hi s lodge with branches and some barks
for covering.

Then did Gosadaya say to the trees, 0 It is

We had the pri.vilege of taking our Senior Cltiz.ens to Mt. Pleasant Reservation to have a

ASTROLOGY-THE MISUNDERSTOOD SCIENCE
By Virginia Medacco Herr

Jay Sil verheels left thi.s world on Wednesday
Ma:rcl:l 5, 1980 ~ ·Jhe tollowing are quotations
from AP .and UPI.

(The following, is reprinted in part from
The Wyoming 'Community Education Reporter
where it was first published in March 1977 }

"Born Harold J. Smith on the· Six Nations
Indian Reservation in Ontario, Canada; he
was given the name Silverheels by a Mohawk
tribal elder. He used it as his stag~ name,
legally changing his name to Silverheels
nine years ago."

Curio~ity, rather than being a "believer"
~'dlsbelievert 11 prompted me to go into the

study _of astrology seven years ago·.

Sfarting wj'..th a book.1which.to my amazement ,
described very aourately, characteristics
of people born under certain "signs,'' my cur~osity was aroused ·.enough to investigate
. fu;-ther. I ~tart~ with some.very basic
classes in C01]111lUn,ity Education and that was
enough
get me started as a very serious
student 9f astrology. And as I have alr eady
stated, afte~ seven years of investigation
and observatioo I am.throughly convinced that
astrology is indeed VALID!

"Among his other movie credits were 'Key
Largo;' 'True Grit,' 'The Man who Loved Cat
Dancing,' and 'The Will Rogers Story.'"

to

"Last Augest, Silverheels became the fir~t
American Indian to have his star set in
Hollywood's Walk of Fame."
Jay founded 'the indian Actor's Workshop in
Hollywood in 1960. He was always a strong
supporter of the Indian cause. He will be
greatly missed.

.

Astrology has been invaluable to me as far
as gaining insight into my own personaHty
and also in helping me really understand my
children, family and friends better. Although the~e are many more skeptics when it
comes to astrology, I am happy to report
that there are some enlightened scientists,
astronomers among them, as well as educators,
psychiatrists, and psychologists who are
using it in their work.

A "believer".
is usually someone who believes in something
on blind faith,. but being one who does not
believe everything that s6meone tells them,
f decided to find put for myself.

"Arriving in Hollywood in 1933 as a profess ..
lonal lacrosse player and a semi-professional hockey player, Silverheels by 1938 had
turned to films as an extra at. the urging
of sports minded actor Joe E. Brown."

Editor's note: The following letter was written by an Indian mother to a Non-Indian teacher .of Indian children. It isa sensitive and
eloquent statement we feel sure will be of
interest to our readers. The letter was first
printed .in the Powell River News of British
Columbia, Canada.
·

Oear Teacher:
Before you take charge of the classroom that
contains my child, please ask yourself why you
are going to teach Indian children. What are
your expectations - what r~ards do you anticipate - what ego-needs will .our children have
to meet? ·
·
Write down and examine all' the tnformation and
opinions you .posses$ about Indians • . What are
the stereotyf>es and interested assumptions that
you br!ng with. you .into the classro~? How many
negative attitudes towards Indians w.111 you put
before my chil_d?
· ·
·
What values, class prejudices and moral ~ principle~
do you take for granted· as.· an!vers~l? Please
remember that "dlfferent from" is .not the same
as "worse than" or "better than", and the yardstick you use to measure your.oWf\ life satisfactori l y may not be appropriate for their ·
lives. The term 'culturally-deprived' was not
invented by well~meaning middle-class whites
to describe something they could not understand .
Too ma(ly t eachers, :unfortunately, sefflll to see
their ·role .. as. fescuer. My child dues not need
to be rescued; he does not consider being Indian
a misfortune. He has a culture, probably older
than .yours; he has meaningful valuc;s ~nd a rich
and.varied experimental background. However
strange or incomprehensible it may seem ·tQ you,
you .have no right to do or say ·a nything that
implies to him that it ·is less than satlsfac~ory.

Our ehlldren•s experiences have· ;been different
frooi those of the 'typical' · white. middle-class _
child for whom most schoo1-·curricula seem to ;: ;v
have been designed. (I suspect that this 'typiQ ,:
cal' child' does not exist except in the minds
of curriculum writers) •. Nonetheless, my child's
experiences have,. been as intense a~d meaningf ul to him as any .child's. like m0st Indian
chi ldren his age, he is competent. He can
dress himself, prepare .a meal for himself and
clean up afterwards, care for a. younger ch.i ld.
~ knows his reseJ;"ves ·like the ~ack of his hand.

Will you help my child to learn to read;. o.
will you teach him that" he has a read' .~g pr<.
blE.~m? Will .you help him develop problem-solvlng skills, or will· you teach him tha~ school
is .where you try to guess what answer the
teachers . wa~t? Will he .learn that his' sense of
his own value and dignity is valid, or will he
learn that he must forever to apologetic and
try harder because .his isn't whit.e? Can you
help him acquire the intellectual skills he
needs without at the same time imposing your
values on top of those he already ha_s?

He is not accustomed to having-to

ask permission
t o do the ordinary things that are part of normal living. He is seldom forbidden to do any ...
thing, more usually the consequences of an action
are explained to him, and he.is allowed· to deside .for himself whether or not to act.

Part C Report for October 1980.
Currently in Adult Education one individual has completed the credits for
high school diploma and one individual has completed the G.E.D. test.
Two other individuals have successfully completed sections of the G.E.O.
test, currently twenty (20) Indian adults are actively working toward
their G.E.D. or high school diploma. This is far below past years.
Recently a reorganization plan has been developed in order to increase
attendance by Indian adults. This will involve a reorganization of the
community education staff so that certain staff members are assigned to work
specifically with the Indian adults.
Outreach Report for October 1980.

Report prepared by Shirley McDonald.

I don't have much to report at this time other than our Senior lunch program
on Mondays and Tuesdays and it is really growing. We serve on the average
of (20) elders each time. last year around this time we had on the average
of 8 to 12 people.
The Seniors participated in the Lexington Fall Festival selling baked goods
and raffle tickets for home made quilt. This money goes towards keeping their
program going. Right now we are trying to save for a second hand T.V. so they
will have one to watch while the dinner is being prepared.
I 1 m really happy for the way our Senior program is growing. Hopefully, we
can plan lunch for more than 2 days a week in the near future.
We are having our annual Ghost Supper for Native American community on Oct.
30, 1980. We are hoping for a good turn out.
CETA Program Report.
The CETA III Program this year will consist of a Public Service Program, PSE,
Work Experience, and Classroom training.
The PSE component will continue to fund the Outreach staff positions (5) and two
office personnel positions. The Work Experience program is designed to provide
the Indian community with manpower to assist in weatherization, painting, minor
repairs, and hauling of trash. The program will be coordinated through the
Outreach Dept.
No funds are available for materials. Persons interested in getting help should
fill out a Work Request form which is available at the GRITC office.
The classroom training will provide an opportunHy for Indian students to
classes at Lexington Community Ed. and work toward obtaining their G.E.D.
high school equivalency. The participants will be paid an allowance, for
20 hours per week. Hopefully this will lead to the participants becoming
employable.

The CETA II B program wi11 provide an opportunity for participants to work on a
worksite for 32 hours per week, and attend classes for 8 hours per week. The
GRITC has been wol'"king on deve1oping additional worksite.s and so far we have
gotten three more. Part of the classroom training portion incliJdes a career
development class which is designed to teach participants skills in job seeking,
such as; how to prepare for an interview, resume writing, and planning for a
career.

Indian Child Welfare Sept. &Oct. Report
We have written letters to various agencies in Grand Rapids to establish contact
and to schedule meetings to explain our program and how we can be of assistance
to them. We feel that after explaining our program, we will be receiving far
more contacts and referrals than the first two (2) months of the program. We
have eight (8) contacts regarding children.
I attended a workshop in Mt. Pleasant on October 9, which was very helpful to
me in understanding the roles of the Tribal Courts, Probate Courts, D.S.S.
Protective Services in implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act.

The purpose and mission of the Indian Child Welfare agency is to prevent the
unnecessary and unwarranted removal of Indian children from their natural

Indian Child Welfare Agency win keep Indian children within
the extended family and communities from which they came .
To work with Indian families to reconstruct the

Where it is not possible to return Indian
children to their natural environment, it will
utilize the existing Native American foster homes
and/or adoptive homes.
The MichiQan Indian Child Welfare Agency will actively
recruit Indian families for foster and adoptive care.
Additionally, the Michigan Indian Child Welfare Agency
will wherever possible place only for short term care,
with the best interest of the child in mind, and the

The Michigan Indian Child Welfare Agency is looking
for Indian foster pJrents who are capable of offering
a stable home, with plenty of love and affection to
Indian children who for one reason or another cannot
stay in their homes.

from the liquid and chop the meat into very fine pieces. Return meat to the
liquid in the pot. Stir in the acorn meal. Add salt & pepper to taste.
Heat the mixture and serve.

DO YOU ENJOY POTLUC KS? There will be a Thanksgiving Day potluck at Lexington
School on Wednesday, November 26 at 12:00 noon. Everyone is welcome. Please
bring your favorite dish to pass. Hope to see you all there.

KIDNEY DONOR NEEDED
Twenty-seven year old Joseph (.Joker)_ Corbi'ne of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band
of Lake Superi'or Chippewas: i's, badly- i:n need of a kidney donor,
Corbine, a Vietnam war veteran lost both kidneys in a operation last year to
save his life after both kidneys began to deteriorate, lost function and began
to cause infections. Because of recent complications on the kidney dialysis
machine, Corbine has been placed on a priority donor list across the country,
but family members feel that due to his Indian ancestry, blood and tissue
matches would have a better chance to match with another American Indian.
Family tests for matching turned up negative.
If in your family or community their is a death, where a kidney could be
donated for trans pl ant, the family of Joe Carbine would appreciate greatly if
you would contact doctors immediately, first to save the kidney of the deceased
and secondly to see if they will match.
Persons to contact are as follows: To notify the family call (.715} 634-3494,
Ellen Gordon Rt. 2, Hayward, WI - For the Veterans Hospital (MN) call (612)
725-6767, Doctor Korchek - for the MN. Kidney Foundation, call (612) 645-8606
or write for donor cards at 1595 Selby Ave., St. Paul. Kidney Foundations
around the country cross-reference for patients, but if you request them to
check on Joe Corbines particular case they will.

NOVEMBER OUTREACH REPORT
SHIRLEY MCDONALD, DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH
This year we are not having any special Thanksgiving occasion for
the elders because of the Thanksgiving potluck that is being put on by
Lexington Community Education. You recall last year they took a trip to
Chicago for the pow-wow. We did have an afternood of Bingo, last Monday
for the few that stayed after lunch. We have had people from Pullman and
Holland come and share dinner with us lately. It shows that people from
different areas are really interested in our lunch program. We are still
looking for more support from staff and board members ...
You see, the money we get for the lunches we sell is turned into food for
the next meal.
We have also been having bake sales every Friday for this cause. Starting
December 1, we will be selling raffle tickets for the Seniors Christmas
Party. We will appreciate any kind of donation (food, money, veg., etc.)
that will help us out for the community's Christmas.
Our work program has been picking up a little bit. Jobs so far have been
raking leaves, moving people aDd different little odds and ends.
Tuesday, December 2, we will be taking (35) youngsters from 5-12 years on a
Christmas shopping trip sponsored by the Grand Rapids Jaycee's.

NOVEMBER PART C REPORT
MIKE CONNOLLY
One more individual completed their GED test and one completed their high
school diploma during the past month. This made four completions for the
year. Five more individuals are within one test of earning their GED
certificate. Indian Adult attendance has increased greatly since the
beginning of the classroom training program under CETA III. A monitoring
system is currently being developed and should be distributed to the Board
by next meeting. The survey being undertaken has been completed. The
response by participants was excellent. The data should be available by
March.

CONDENSED MINUTES OF BOARD MEETING HELD NOVEMBER 4, 1980.
ON FILE AT 45 LEXINGTON N.W.

ORIGINAL MINUTES

Board Members Present:

Pat Rawlings, Barbara Arzola, Jeanette St. Clair,
Mary Church, John Hart, Kathy Stinger, George Martin.

Staff Present:

J.W. Wheeler, Mike Connolly, Shirley Lark, Geri
Conway.

Guests:

Chuck Scalla

Meeting was called to order at 7:40 p.m. by President Pat Rawlings.
Mary Church made a motion to accept the October minutes, seconded by Barbara
Arzola. Motion carried.
Chuck Scalla addressed the Board. Organizing a basketball league for kids
3rd grade thru 10 at the YMCA (downtown). He is recruittng ktds to participate
and adults to volunteer as coaches. Registration is November 8, but could
register at a later date. Basic fundamentals are taught first, with team
assignments scheduled for December. Anyone interested may register at the
YMCA or call 451-1141 ext. 234 or 235.
Wag gave report on the Bridge St. building status for the National Historic
Register. May be impractical due to the fact the building would have to be
restored to exact structure and furnishtngs. Needs to be researched further.
Very little response from HUD, possibility of city's Community Development
Program funds for restoring. Selling is still a possibility. All utilities
have been shut-off and pipes drained at the Bridge St. building, but maintenance (winter) is still our responsibility. Building should be utilized.
possible to shut off upstairs because of the safety factor, and just use the
downstairs offices. Need to check with the Fire Marshall as to whether we
could bar the windows and still use the building.
Mike Connolly gave a report on Adult Education, CETA III. A little hard to
keep track of Indian students because of the whole Adult Education Program
at Lexington combining. To date, one has their GED certificate and one has
finished high school since September. CETA III has initiated a classroom
training program for 17 to 21, with a few 16 year olds. They receive an
allowance of $3.10 an hour for up to 20 hours per week. Twenty students are
enrolled, with a waiting list of 15. The program planned for 50-75 to enter
and finish the program, 40-50 will actually finish. We enrolled some people
who have never been enrolled in any of our programs before to get them more
involved.
Wag gave Greg and Shirley McDonald's reports in their absence. Greg will be
in Washington next week to finalize our CETA III grant. Our allotment for the
1980-81 program will be $148,333 - an increase of about $4,500 over the last
years' grant. CETA IIB has initiated a 32 hr. work experience and 8 hour
classroom program. The 32 hours are mandatory, with the 8 hours voluntary, but
paid attendance. Seventy-five people are enrolled in the Career Development
class, this combines the CETA III and II-B participants.
The Ghost Supper had a

hug~

turnout.

condensed minutes cont.
Wag reported on the status of the Owl Program. Right now we are planning
agreement for two months - October and November, but wil1 be extending into
the middle of December. Said we could have $3,000 a month for expenses,
but figure we can only spend $4,100 for the ten week period. We have received
$1 ,000 advance, with the balance to be paid on a monthly reimbursement basis.
Kim Hoag has been hired as a consultant to research various other Substance
Abuse programs and resource people around the country. He is doing a fantastic
job.
We feel that the concept of the substance abuse program should be changed and
incorporate both the Christian and traditional views in treating clients.
We plan on holding a "Public Hearing" (rap session) in order to get input
from the community on the kinds of help, assistance, program everyo~e feels
is needed, probably in about three weeks. May invite some Christian and
traditional people to have a prayer meeting to start the program off to a
good start, thus eliminating any problems that may artse from the eventual
direction of the substance abuse program.
Geri Reported on the Indian Child Welfare Program
I attended a workshop in Mt. Pleasant on October 9, 1980. It was very informative as to the problems that the Tribal Courts, D.S.S. Protective Services,
and Probate Courts are having implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act. We
have received two responses to our letters to the different agencies in town.
Hopefully, we will hear this month from the rest. We have had eight contacts
dealing with children the past two months.
The next Board of Directors Meeting will be December 2, 1980, at Lexington
School.
Kathy Stinger made a motion to adjourn the meeting, seconded by John Hart.
Motion carried.
Meeting adjourned at 9:57 p.m.

BOOS HOO!
Even though the school year is almost half over, the Native American
Education Staff in the Grand Rapids Public Schools would like to extend a
greeting to everyone. The staff has been busy identifying Indian students
in the schools, serving as liaisons between the students, school and home,
taking care of referrals for special assistance, tutoring in special cases,
giving classroom presentations about Indians, and the list goes on and on.
If there is any way in which we can further render services, do give us a
call at 456-4226 or do stop and see us at 45 Lexington N.W.
Parent Committee Meetings take place regularly on a monthly basis,
namely, the second Wednesday of each month at 12:00 noon at Lexington School.
If you wish to give any sug~estions or input into the program please feel
welcome to attend any or all of the meetings. Remember, the Native American Education Program is a program that is serving your children. On
December 17, 1980, at 7:00 p.m. a Public Hearing will take place for the
purpose of planning next year's program. Do plan to attend and give your
ideas.
The program does render services to all the Indian children in the
Grand Rapids Public Schools should a need arise, but since the staff is
few in number they work in assigned target schools. The following list

I fixed my eyes upon the water
the reflection stared back at me
caught me in a moment of depth that echoed throughout my IDody
Shrilling and Whiny
Inside I was hollow
I couldn't grab hold of it .... only remember
The water used to arise in my soul
impassion me with tranquility
How I loved sitting on that hillside, with you
Listening, tentively, to the ecstatic whisper of
cool winds breeze about the lake
Watch the sun disappear with a hint of red
so delicate in the sky
It seemed nothing could touch this virtue
You filled my soul then
But, that was, so long ago ....

SENIOR Is NEWS
ENERGY AID FOR SENIORS
If you're 60 years of age or older, and you have a problem paying your gas bill
write or visit Michigan Consolidated today. You may be eligible for financial aid
through the Senior Citizen Energy Assistance Program.
Here's how the plan works:
When you tell us that you are a senior citizen and you are having bill payment
problems, we'll do two things: First, we'll code your account as senior citizen
so that, should you fall behind in your bill payments, your gas service will not
be shut off in the winter. Second, we'll put you in touch with a Mich·1gan Community
Action Agency or an Area Agency on Aging. They will see if you meet the income
eligibility requirements for financial assistance. If you qualify, your heating
bills could be taken care of until spring.
So write or visit a Michigan Consolidated office today. Or visit your local Area
Agency of Aging or Michigan Community Action Agency and ask about the Senior Citizen
Energy Assistance Program. It's Michigan Consolidated's way of helping senior
customers pay gas bills.
There are many other programs available from Michigan Consolidated and from
federal, state and local agencies to help seniors and all our customers. For a
detailed description write for our free booklet:

FOR ALL TO KNOW
WHAT IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?
First of all, let's define nonnal blood pressure. Blood pressure is the force
of blood against the walls of the arteries. When the pressure within these blood
vessel becomes too high, a person is said to have high blood pressure or hypertension. High blood pressure and hypertension does not necessarily mean you are
a "hyper" or tense individual.
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?
Approximately 23 million people in the U.S. have high blood pressure.
about 15% of the white population and 25% of the minority population.

It affects

WHO GETS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?
Anyone can get high blood pressure (even children, although it is not as common
as in adults). Those in a high risk group are people who are overweight, have a
family history of high blood pressure, are older than 50 years and/or a minority
group.
HOW WILL I KNOW IF I HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?
High blood pressure is a "sneaky" disease. Usually, there are no symptoms.
(Rarely, people with high blood pressure complain of headaches, nose bleeds, or
shortness of breath). Usually the only way you can tell if your blood pressure is
high is to have your blood pressure taken. Your doctor, nurse, or other professional
can check it for you .
WHAT CAUSES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?
Although many idfferent diseases may cause high blood pressure, 90% of the time
no cause is known.
WHY IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE SO DANGEROUS?
Simply stated, left untreated, it can knock years off of your li'fe. Life insurance companies have researched the relationship between high blood pressure and
life expectancy. Their studies reveal that even mild high blood pressure, untreated, can mean actual years of life lost.
If high blood pressure is left uncontrolled, it can damage vital organs namely
the heart by causing heart attacks and heart failure. High blood pressure, in
affecting the brain, is a leading cause of strokes.
WHAT EFFECT DOES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE HAVE ON THE KIDNEYS?
High blood pressure can cause kidney damage. The type of high blood pressure
causing this damage is called "primary" hypertension, and is incurable, but can be
controlled. High pressure in the blood vessels of the kidneys causes them to become
sclerotic (thickened). As this reduces the blood supply to the kidneys they can
no longer function efficiently. Therefore, they become less effective in removing
waste products from the body. Salt is retained instead of being properly eliminated,
which causes the body to hold fluid. This extra fluid puts a burden on the heart
causing it to fail. Which in turn creates a vicious cycle, as the heart then
supplies the kidneys with less blood, causing the kidneys further damage.
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?
Have your blood pressure checked often. Sometimes it takes more than one reading
to get the correct count. If your blood pressure is high your doctor will prescribe
medication.
WHERE CAN I GO TO GET MY BLOOD PRESSURE CHECKED?
You and your family may get your blood pressure checked FREE at Westside
Complex from 9:00-11 :00 a.m. and from 1:00-4:00 p.m. every day. For more information call 774-3957.

Long time ago when Buffalo were plenty and Mother Earth was
young, Prairie Chicken would dance during mating season showing
off his beautiful feathers for the woman he longed for. The
Nishnawbe men were watching this great exhibition and thought how
nice it would be if they could dance in this manner also, so they
made feathered outfits of many colors and learned the dance well.
Now the women were starting to become jealous of the men for
having such a beautiful dance that they couldn't participate in,
so they made their own outfits and learned their own style of
the Prairie Chicken dance (fancy dance). Now the men and the
women were both happy as they danced proudly with the sound of
the drum penetrating through their bodies. The drum, we know is
the heartbeat of all nations. The men drummed to honor the women
in respect for the gift of life that women have.
As time went on and people started to forget, or disregard
their heritage, they lost respect for the drum which also showed
lack of respect for women, and themselves.
Today we are trying to bring back the spirituality of the drum
for deep inside we all feel the respect and we are trying to pass
this on at Pow Wows and in drum class, I hope we all learn well.

CHINIWIDWINA-BIGSTORM
The wind howling
Great with power .... Almost knocking you down
lightning, to break the darkness
trying to capture your attention
As if mad
Rain, pouring down
As if trying to wash away all sins .. renew you .. in haste
Screaming Thunder
You can't help but listen
Wondering
What he'll say next
then it passes
With a whisper of silence
And
a
rainbow
to guide you .... on a new day.

MRS. DOMINIC: "DEFINE AN INDIAN"
by Dennis Chase
The Northern Michigan Ottawa Association (NMOA) would like the word
INDIAN redefined.
loose interpretations have made it possible for white men to be
recognized as Indian, according to Waunetta Dominic, president of the NMOA.
"Take the fishing issue, 11 Mrs. Dominic said. 11 The State of Michigan,
the Interior Department, the local clubs - they are dealing with white men
not Indians. They are wasting time and money dealing with them. They still
have to deal with treaty Indians. If they {government). want to talk treaty
they should talk treaty with the Indians not the white men. They (Sault
Chippewa Band) say they are exercising treaty rights. But what treaty are
they talking about? They are not on the (Durant) roll. 11
The Durant roll was a federal census taken in 1910 to determine the
number of Indians in the state who qualified under the terms of the Treaty
of 1836. Persons listed on the roll were at least 1/2 Indian blood.
11
The government did not deal with anyone who didn't have 1/2 Indian
blood or more, 11 she said, adding that a number of 11 recognized 11 Indians
today have less than that .
. Mrs. Dominic believes that a 1/2 blood definition would be fair with
the stipulation that Indians could extend privleges to others with less than
1/2 blood.
11
If Indian was redefined, the government would save millions of dollars, 11
she said. "Right now they are paying for and allowing privleges to white men.
They have really broadened the definition. There are some who claim they are
1/32 or 1/64 Indian. I don't think you can prove you're Indian when you get
down that far. 11
"Indians should strive to keep their identy instead of letting the white
man take over. 11
Mrs. Dominic said the NMOA is also concerned about 11 discrimination 11
against non-federally recognized tribes.
11
That 1 s another issue we question, 11 she said. 11 And we're going to push
that issue, too. 11
Mrs. Dominic said 11 a lot of privleges and rights" are being granted to
federally recognized Indians but not to non-federally recognized Indians. As
an example, she said she recently won a decision that allowed non-federally
recognized Indians to attend an Indian clinic at Kincheloe. However, she
said, there is still a battle being waged as to whether non-federally recognized tribes can receive supplemental support if they need to go elsewhere for
nedical reasons.
Also, non-federally recognized tribes have not been extended the fishing
rights that federally recognized tribes have, although Mrs. Dominic said only
a handful of members from her association 11 want to commercial fish. 11
11
The majority of our tribe fish mainly for subsistence. 11 At its meeting
on Saturday, the NMOA also agreed to get "some of the claim money" - that totals
nearly $17 million - banked in Michigan. A member of the Bureau of Indian
Affairs is working with the group on that matter. Mrs. Dominic said she has
been in contact with officials from Michigan Bank North.
11
We strongly believe that the economy of Michigan is more important than
the economy of other state. 11
The NMOA also elected officers Saturday. Those elected includes: Mrs.
Dominic, president; Steve Shomin (Detroit), vice-president; Anthony Chinman
(Pentwater), interpreter; Ann Smith (Bay Shore), treasurer; Pauline Barber
(Williamsburg}, secretary; Don Davenport (Harbor Springs), Gladys laws (Lansing),
Joe John (Grand Rapids) and Joe Ginia (Muskegon), counselors. The NMOA will
appoint a committee to investigate the Child Welfare Act at a future meeting.

CIVIL SERVICE BOARD
CITY OF GRAND RAPIDS
MICHIGAN
Proceedings of the Civil Service Board
Committee of the Whole
Roll Call - Present:
Absent:

Mr. Brown, Mr. Jabin, Mr. Jones, Mr. Post, &Mrs. Williams.
None

The Civil Service Board, sitting as a Committee of the Whole, met on August
5, 1980 for the purpose of considering the matter of minority qualification
of American Indians.
The Chairperson asked for comments from any interested person present at the
meeting. A general discussion ensued during which various persons stated
their views on the question being discussed. It was generally agreed that
some standard needed to be established in order that a person could be considered as an American Indian for minority classification purposes. The
Chief Examiner explained both present and past practices with regard to this
matter.
It was moved by Mrs. Williams, seconded by Mr. Jones, and carried, that the
following criteria be adopted for the purpose of establ isliing American Indian
status for Civil Service Board purposes.
American Indian Status

,.. That in order to qualify for City of Grand Rapids hiring, American
Indians must be one-fourth blood degree, or

2.

is a member of a recognized tribe or band of Indians, or

3.

the individual establishes Indian status by means of community
identification and recognition as a bona fide American Indian
through the Inter-Trioal Council or the Michigan Commission on
Indian Affairs, or by such other means as may be appropriate.

It was noted that presentation of the appropriate certification documents
would meet the criteria set forth in Items l and 2, and that the burden of
proof would be with the individual in connection with Item 3 of the criteria.

"THE PEOPLE OF IBE GRA\JD" -- a report on a new permanent exhibit at the Gra!1d Rapids
?ublic Museum prepared for Joe John by W. o.. fr~nkforter,
Museum Di rector.
..-· .
"The People of the Grand," a pennanent exh~bit on prehistoric and historic Indian cultures in the Grand Rapids area .w'ill open at the Grand Rapids
Public Museum on November 14. This display, wh\ch has been in preparation for
approximately four years, begins with a three-dimensional projection diorama
which explains how the glaciers of the Ice Age modified the land, creating
the Great Lakes, and producing the landscape into which the first Native
Americans entered.
There is evidence in the eastern United States that the Late Ice Age
elephant, the mastodon, was still living when the first Indians came into the
region, at least 11,000 to 12,000 years ago. This introductory exhibit is a
full-scale diorama, incorporating a 40 by IS foot mural depicting the valley at
Grand Rapids at that time. It shows the Paleo-Ind~ans hunting mastodons and,
in the foreground .. the skeleton of a mastodon is shown sinking into a bog.
This exhibit is based .on the discovery of a skeleton earlier in this century
in a bog near 1-borland in northern Muskegon County. The scattering of the bones
and the fact that some pieces were missing suggests that the animal was killed
and dismembered by the early hunters. Mastodon remains have been found in
gravel pits in Grand Rapids as well.
The displays follow .. in chronological order .. illustrating the history of
the Native Americans as reconstructed from archeological and historical records.
The earl ie~t type of spe.arpoint .. named the "Clovis" point 1 is shown. Several
of this type have been found in Michigan .. with at least four reported from
Kent County.
Following the Pal~-Indian section .. the display treats what archeologists
call the "Archaic" period which spanned a period of time between 6, 000 and
3,500 B.C. Great changes were taking place at that time because of a warming
trend following the · Ice Age. The mastodons died out and people turned more
and more to the small animals and to fishing for food. Changes took place in
the type of weapons and tools being made and the first gxound stone items, such
as ''bird stones" and gorgets were produced.
Next .. the displays show the beginning of horticulture with the introduction
of squash and pumpkin.. as well as the first pottery. This occurred in what is
called the Early Woodland .. between 1,500 and 500 .B.C.
A large mural depicts the next stage .. the Middle Woodland which has been
called the "Hopewell" taken from the name of the land owner in Ohio where the
first scientific excavation of this culture was reported. This mural shows the
Indian Mounds southwest of Grand Rapids at a time 2, 000 years ago when a burial
ceremony is about to take place. This site is the largest remaining group of
mounds in Michigan and is an extremely important prehistoric mom.unent. Also
included is a painting showing a grandfather telling younger men the story of
the great Megis (shell) which .. according to Ojibwa .legend, led their ancesters
from the northeast coast to the Great Lakes ove~ a period of several generations.
The exhibit continues with a large, three-dimensional scene showing an
.Indian village at the time of the coming of the first French fur traders. This
is a spring time setting with maple sap being gathered and incorporating a wigwam, as well as the trader and Indians bartering over the furs and trade goods.
Opposite this diorama there is a small amphitheatre where approximately 30
individuals can be seated to watch slides or films on various subjects.

-2-

._. .
1be fi r. al four exhibit cases treat the Ottawa~ Potawatomi, and Ojibwa
tribes in nlation to treaties, clothing styles/ quill work and beadwork, woodworking and general changes in life style that occurred because of the coming
of the white man.
lbis exhibit ends with another full-scale scene which includes a mural
of the river and the Grand Rapids area in 1827 when the Baptist Mission had
been built on the west side and Louis Campau was constructing his first fur
trading post on the east side. A log cabin has been built to represent the
Mission and will be outfitted with appropriate benches, a table, and other
furnishings which would have been necessary.
1bis display will provide visitors with a concept of what happened during the prehistoric period in the Grand Rapids area. A second half of 111be
People of the Grand" will treat the history of Grand Rapids from 1826 to the
year A.O. 2,000. This portion of the display will not be done, ·however, until
a master plan ~or the Museum, now being developed, has been completed.
Consultant' on this exhibit have included Joe John, Rose Star Chief, Mr.
and Mrs. Chuck Bailey, Mr. and Mrs. John Chisholm, Isaac Pet~rs, Loretta
Antoine, Michael Dominic, and Dr. Richard Flanders. The exhibit has been
designed, fabricated, and installed by the staff of the Grand Rapids Public
Museum.

LAMENTATION ASTRANGERO
0 Lord I am but a fragment, tossed and torn by destiny. Like a grain of
sand degraded by the four winds. A desire for knowledge makes the mind
impatient. Send it soaring through heavens search,ing for a bright star to
light the path of destiny. It thirsts for knowledge and is prohibited by
the indifference of the ignorant. Mankind without love is a lifeless body
without purpose. If I tear my heart from my chest, and give it to you in a
golden chalice, will you treasure it or would you throw it to the four winds?

BIRTH-REBIRTH

We become stronger with each new birth
just look around and you'll see
The little boys singing hard at the drum
and wearing their braids proudly.
When the heart beat of the drum is pounding
do you feel it as your own
And can you hear the voices singing
Calling out to you, come home.
Where all Nations join together
and our elders faces glow
To your native ways, your language
where the peaceful waters flow.
And do you feel the war's end is near
in the "Battle of Alcohol"
where many have died
and still some yet to fall.
The spirit is so strong you can feel the
strength arising from all directions
of the earth.
Even those adopted into Non-Indian
families are coming home to join us in
our spiritual rebirth.

OTTAWA NATION

I know now that my goal is set
The choice made not by me
But by a will of greater men
Those whose souls are free
By those who give us strength in truth
And keep our Nation alive
By those who give us heart & health
And help us to survive
And though my mind is slightly fogged
I'll one day see so clear
And all my soul will be filled
With strength more powerful than fear
I'll show my kids the greatest love
They will not know of greed
They'll have the greatest strength of all
For their hearts alone will succeed
And when my bodies dead and gone
My heart will live in the land
And peace will sound on forever
Just as the whispers of the sand ...
Kareen Lewis

1981, for high school completion. So far, we have seven people interested in Auto

about offering Michigan Indian History. Anyone interested just let us know. Last
year the Title VI, Kent County Ceta, was written ~r a recreation program. This
year the youth will be working in the substance abuse program. Mike prepared the
proposal CETA VI for the coming year. This needs approval and a resolution. The

VOICES

Quiet forrest, silent birds only
the wind to hear.
Still your motions, settle deeply,
let the sound drift near.
Woman talking, low and laughing,
down the creek away.
Hear her voices, softly singing, words
are still astray.
Settle deeper, lie down with her,
let the song inside you grow.
Understanding one another like a
river flows.
Raise your voices, join in with
her, sing your songs unto the wind.
You have finally found Earth Mother
and she has found a friend.

Child, ask your mother where
your path begins.
Child, ask your father where
your path ends.
Child, ask the Grandfather to guide
your feet lest you stray.
Child, you have but to look where
you walk, your heart knows
the way.

WHAT IF YOUR LANDLORD REFUSES TO MAKE REPAIRS?
- A tenant could have three options:
1. In building with three or more units located in cities with more than
10,000 persons, you might be able to pay your rent to the city's rent
escrow account. However, you may do this ~if your landlord never
got a certificate of compliance with local bu1lding and health laws,
or if your landlord has been investigated and his certificate of compliance has been suspended or withheld by the city.
2.

Another thing a tenant can do is to refuse to pay any more rent to the
landlord until needed repairs are done. Under state law, in most
situations where a landlord tries to evict a tenant for not paying rent,
a court has the power to reduce the rent that has to be paid for the
reason that the landlord has not kept the rental unit in good repair.
Because you cannot predict how much, if any, the court may reduce the
rent that must be paid. It is very important that the tenant set aside
and save the rent money amount as it becomes due. The tenant should
also notify the landlord that the rent money is being withheld because
.certain definite repairs are needed or certain conditions need to be
improved.

3.

A tenant may also take his or her rent money and use it to make needed
repairs that the landlord refuses to do. If the tenant does this, he/
she should notify the landlord of doing these repairs, and the tenant
should make sure to save any receipts or other records proving that the
repairs have been done.

If a tenant pays rent to the city rent escrow account, withholds rent, or uses
rent money to make need repairs, it is very possible that the landlord may take
the tenant to court to evict him/her.
If the landlord sues to evict you, you may have good legal defenses to the
eviction suit. You should try to get legal advice if you are paying rent to the
city rent escrow account, withholding rent, or using your rent to make repairs.
Under Michigan law, it is illegal for your landlord to forcibly evict you by
locking you out of your apartment or cutting off your utility service. You may
be able to get a court order to stop the landlord from interfering with your
right to live in the apartment, plus money damages. If your landlord does try
to forcibly evict you, you should seek legal advise immediately.
If you have other questions, you can call the Tenant's Union at 241-6429 or
call the Outreach Department at the Grand Rapids Inter-Triba.1 Council at
774-8331 .
Another number to call if you cannot afford legal counseling is 774-2952.
is the Family law Office of legal Aid.
If you would like a copy of the DO YOU RENT brochure, call 774-8331 and ask
for the Outreach Department.

Program Meets .
Needs Of
Native Americans
The Native American Education Program is funded through the U.S. Office
of Indian Education, Washington, D.C.
The program provides a wide variety of
services to Native American students.
The services include paraprofessional
tutoring and support for students in need
of special assistance, cultural awareness
(field trips, book distribution and presentation), and identification of student
health needs and services.

THE ABOVE ARTICLE WAS PRINTED IN THE GRAND RAPIDS PUBLIC SCHOOLS
ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1979-80.

!.
WHY ARE THE 506 FORMS SO IMPORTANT? WHY SHOULD YOU GET YOURS COMPLETED?
The Federal government requires all Native Americans who are counted for
funding under Title IV, Part A, to be certified. The certification can be
documented in several ways. However, in all circumstances a federal form,
called a "506" must be signed by parents or legal guardians.
At this time there are less than 300 "506 1 s 11 out of an estimated 750
students. The possible loss of funds (about half), would drastically reduce
the services of this program. Any student who has at least one grand parent
that is 1/4 Indian is eligible.
Let's help keep this fantastic program alivel If you have not completed
the 506 form, ca 11 Jeanette St. Clair, or one of her· staff persons, at 456-4226.
If you can, please stop by Lexington School, 45 Lexington N.W., as soon as
poss i b1e.

POPCORN SALES
The popcorn sales at Lexington are booming! Every day students from the
Alternative Education Program pop the corn, bag it up, and sell it to Lexington's
staff and students. Why? They are saving money to take a week long trip to
Rooseveltown, New York, the place where they publish the Akwesasne Notes.
If you are at Lexington and you see the students selling their popcorn,
buy a bag to help them out. The charge is a measly 25¢ and the popcorn is
delicious. Let's all help the Alternative Education students go on their trip!

(THE FOLLOWING LETTER WAS SENT TO ALL PARENTS WHO HAVE CHILDREN IN THE GRAND
RAPIDS PUBLIC SCHOOLS.)
Dear Pa rent,
This letter is a special request for you to sign the "506" form that is
enclosed. An explanation about the program and services received from the
pro gram fo 11 ows.
The Native American Education Program in the Grand Rapids Public Schools
provides financial assistance under Part A of the Indian Education Act to
develop and carry out elementary and secondary school projects that meet the
special educational and culturally related academic needs of Indian children.
The program is staffed by six persons - the coordinator, a secretary and
four Native American Service Specialists and the Specialists work mainly with
students in target areas. Service, however, is rendered to any Indian student
in the Grand Rapids Public Schools who is in need, and efforts are made to
meet the need.
The Service Specialists act as a liaison between students, school and home,
cultural information is given, tutoring in special cases is provided and classroom presentations on Indians are given upon request.
To be eligible for services from the Native American Education Program,
the government requires that a "506" form be fi 11 ed out and signed by a parent
or guardian. Without a form on file, a student may not receive any benefits
from the program. Perhaps your child may not have any special needs, then
signing a form may help some other Indian student who is in need.
This letter and the "506" form are being sent to you because your child
indicated he/she had Indian ancestry through a survey that was taken this fall
in the Grand Rapids Public Schools. If you have already signed a form, then
please disregard this request.
If you have further questions, give us a call at 456-4226 or stop by and
see us at 45 Lexington N.W., Lexington School, Room 6.
Sincerely,

~.:«<---4l- ~.)

EAGL E

The Great Spirit was looking for something that would help guide the
American Indian and all living creatures to make a living for themselves and
to survive by hunting for their food according to the Great Spirit.
A bird called "Gah-Eassle" by the Indians which was known as an Eagle
was later adopted as a national bird by the Americans.
The eagle was known by the Indians as the bird of wisdom, a bird of
swiftness, a bird of bravery, a bird that could fly great heights, see all
and guide all those who are in search of their wisdom.

The feathers from an eagle have been used as awards for warrior's achievement. For each event that was completed, an award was given by the chief. As
each warrtor was honored and wore his feathers at all ceremonies, the accumu1at ion of feathers showed his bravery and accompli'shments in the tri'be.
The Great Spirit helped the American Indian in using the eagle to illustrate
what he stood for and his accomplishments for mankind. The American Indian has
continued to use the eagle feather with a great deal of honor because of what
the ancestors had known about the honor the eagle had given to the people and
the powers that went wtth the user of the eagle feather,
Toda/s American fndians use the eagle feather i.n all thetr I'ndi.an ins pi r~
ational ceremonies.

THE ORIGIN OF THE GRAND RIVER BAND OF OTTAWA INDIANS
Gordon L. Olson
December, l 980
PART ONE
When Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle crossed Michigan's lower peninsula
from the St. Joseph River to the area that is now Detroit, he described the region
drained by the Grand River as a place "where the Indians did not hunt, because it
lies between five or six tribes which were at war with one another, and they never
entered it without taking great precautions, in order to surprise and kill some
enemy. u l Three years later he reported that the area was 1argely vacant because
of fear of the mighty Iroquois nation.
Accounts by the traders and explorers who followed LaSalle into the region
over the next century and a half tell of the steady efforts of the Ottawa from
northern Michigan to establish dominance. Raiding parties were followed by winter
hunting camps, until by about 1775, permanent villages had been established. Ottawa
from the Straits region began to assert their interest in the area further south
early in the 18th century. In 1706, an Ottawa party attacked the Miami on the St.
Joseph River and Fr. Joseph J. Marest, a Jesuit missionary at Michilimackinac,
wrote that if it were not for the presence of Jesuit pries ts, the Ottawa claim "that
they would take so many men with them against the Miami that, in a short time, they
would drive them out of this beautiful country. "2 A year later many of the Miami
left the area and moved closer to Detroit.
Despite the Jesuit efforts, Ottawa groups continued to visit the Grand River
area. One band is reported to have wintered on the Grand in 1707-08, and in 1712,
an Ottawa chief named Saguina led an attack against the Masco~tins of southwestern
Michigan and then returned to Michilimackinac.3
This pattern persisted for several decades. By 1735, however, there were
indications that some Ottawa were thinking of moving to the area permanently. Joseph
Sieur de Celoron, Commandant at Michilimackinac reported in that ¥ear that the Ottawa
of his area were moving to the Muskegon River area and planned to stay there. Celoron
managed to dissuade them by arguing that "frequent maladies prevail at that place"
that might destroy them and that their winter hunting would be adversely affected by
their maintaining a village in the same locale.4 They continued to winter in the
southern river valleys, bringing their fur harvest to Michilimackinac in the Spring.
Because they went to the same locality each winter, some of these Indians became
known as the Grand River Ottawa. In the late 1740's, Mechoukima, an Ottawa chief,
was reported to have arrived in Montreal "with 34 warriors from Grand River ... 5 The
British and French were engaged in a dispute known as King George's War during these

II

years (1744-1747), and the Indians were present to aid their French allies.
The century-long contest between Britain and France for North America came
to an end in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris that established British hegemony over
the eastern half of the continent. Several diaries, reports and memoirs written
during t he remaining years of the 18th century and the early years of the 19th
century leave little doubt that the Ottawa moved into the Grand River Valley as
year-round residents.
Frederick Hamburgh, a trader, reported in his journal for 1763 that the
Ottawa had a summer village at L' Arbre Croche (one account states that it was
first occupied in 1742), where "they live partly upon fish which are very good and
plenty at this place and in the Winter their chief hunting place is about the great
river (Grand River) ... 6 An anonymous source dated 1771 reported that Ottawa had
a village of eight large cabins at the confluence of the Grand River and Thornapple
River.7 The source does not indicate if this was a permanent settlement or a winter
camp, although the use of the term "vi 11 age" suggests the former.

Booshoo!
How did you know I'd planned to write to the Turtle Talk?! You left
a neat little box with lines for me to write in. From this vantage point
of 2,000 miles away in Berkeley, things look great in Grand Rapids!
Seriously, the Turtle Talk looks terrific. All due respect to past
editors, but I like this new format and color paper - very nice! I'm
impressed with Kareen Lewis's poetry; always did like the traditional orientation to life and her work reflects that. Also, I liked Duane Raphael's
drawing in a recent issue. It's on my wall, along with a poster he did,
plus drawings by Toni Foster and Matthew Medawis. (Hope George Martin visits
Matthew. I think that visit to Jackson sounds very good George!) The
alcohol & drug program with Kim (someone I never met) sounds good with the
1a test "So You Want to Know Who You Are" piece - - it's the truth. Of course,
I'm very pleased to hear of the Elders luncheons being so successful. Keep
~P the good, hard work, elders and Outreach!
Shirley McDonald - I still like those articles you write for the Outreach news - always did like your writing style. (by the way, Shirley, I
took a picture of Eric Jr. last summer that's really cute. It's on my wall
with a bunch of other photographs).
California is a very exciting place. There's a huge Indian population
here in the Bay Area. There are pow wows here year round, and I go to many
of them.
Oh! I heard from a source I'll not identify (up around northern
Wisconsin, Jean, that Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal Council's CSA proposal
ranked #2) Hey! That's a lot of "jeuna" for Outreach & our community.
Congratulations!
Hello Loretta Yount and Geri! I never get a chance to say hello to you
two!

everyone, and write if you want:

;S

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
My name is Barry Provow (wesuhkoodwe). I am an American Indian. I have been incarcerated for 6 years now at the State prison of Southern Michigan. Since my
incarceration I have asked many of the Indian people in Michigan to visit me and
teach me the things of the tribes in Michigan. No one has offered to come. I am
not part of the Michigan Indian tribes, but there are a lot of brothers who are,
and yet our people (Michigan tribes) won't take the time to see them, to teach
them the things of their people or to share part of our life with us here. It
hurts even though I am not part of their tribe.
There is a group here called Indian Nations United (I.N.U.). This group was to
bring all the Indian people together and unite as one people. We were to remember
that even though we come from many different tribes we are but one race, the red
race. Since 1972 this group has tried to bring our own people from all over Michigan into the meetings to share with us their ways of life, to help us understand
our history, our culture, and our religious beliefs, so we can understand what is
happening to us as a people and what we can do to help ourselves and our people
after we get out of prison. So far there has been nobody willing to help us.
I stop and look at other prisons. I look at other brothers and sisters locked behind bars and I see that in other states the Indian people have not forgotten them.
In other prisons they have teachers coming in, they have religious people of their
tribes coming in, they have cultural classes so they can learn of their culture,
and they have elders coming in and talking with them. They are learning from them
so that one day they can help other Indian people so they won't end up in a prison
·
somewhere.
Now getting back to me. I have written many of the Indian organizations throughout
Michigan and the United States to ask for help in learning the ways of our people.
I have asked for spiritual people to contact me. I want to learn more about the
sacred pipe and the spiritual ways of our people. I would also like to learn the
true history of all the Indian tribes throughout tile United States. In writing all
these people and organizations, I have asked, in behalf of I.N.U., that they answer
me. But nobody did. The only organization that offered to help was the Commission
on Indian Affairs (Carolyn Kiogima) and Pinto Project. They can only do so much.
Carolyn has brought people to the meetings, but they can't do that much for us. We
need the Michigan Indians to do something. We need their backing. I am not asking
for the group. I am asking for myself now. I want to learn, so I am asking if
there is someone out there who is willing to give me some of their time. Will someone please give me a little time to teach me the ways of our people. Am I asking
so much that my own people will turn me away? Do I have to beg just to keep alive
what should be sacred to all of us? Have we become so much like them that we will
turn our backs on our own? I have been writing for three years and before that
others have written asking the same thing. How much more do we have to beg you?
How many more of us will be turned away? We don't want to lose our true understanding of the Indian ways before our own wake up. We need you, I need you, our children need you, but who is willing to share with us?

.

I pray to our Grandfather that someone will help us. If you are Indian people please
don't turn us away anymore. May you wake in peace. May your hearts be guided by
the Grandfather.
Sincerely,
Barry Provow

THE DRUNK BABY
When the mother gets drunk, so does the unborn baby. Think of the
baby's delicate, still-forming nervous system, how can it possibly cope
with a drunk or a binge? It can't.
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is the term used for babies born with
defects caused by drinking mothers. In the last ten years extensive research from all over the world has shown that if a pregnant woman drinks
the chance of having a child with some type of defect is almost certain.
There is the possibility of a number of defects for infants born with
FAS. Many FAS babies are born shorter and lighter and will never catch up
to the weight and height they should be, even if special care is given.
Stillbirths show a higher rate among mothers who are heavy drinkers. There
is a high chance of the baby being born mentally retarded to some degree.
Other possible defects are head and facial deformities, body deformities,
heart defects, trembling, a weak grasp, poor coordination, hyperactivity,
extreme nervousness and poor attention. Some FAS babies are born with all
the above traits while others show only a few of these defects to one degree
or another.
There is no cure for a FAS baby. Such a child will be limited mentally
and/or physically for 1 i fe.
How much alcohol does it take? Pregnant women who drink at least six
drinks a day (that's three ounces of liquor) run a sure risk of having a
child showing FAS symptoms. In 19 out of a 100 children born to mothers
who drank an average of four drinks a day show partial FAS abnormalities,
as do 11 out of a 100 babies born to mothers who averaged two drinks a day.
If you don't drink except for a binge now and again there is still a
good chance of your child showing partial FAS symptoms. In fact, recent
research shows that ~alcohol in the mother's bloodstream may affect the
unborn child.
If you are a mother, know the risks involved with drinking. If you
must drink, do so slowly, eat as you drink, and do not drink much. Better
still, especially if you don't have much will-power, don't drink.
Depression is common among expectant mothers. If you're feeling down
find a friend to talk to rather than reaching for a drink. Try writing your
feelings down, take a long walk, turn on some music, pound your pillow, or
try being creative with clothes or beads or paint.
If something is deeply troubling you . try to find the right person to
talk to. The Inter-Tribal Council may be able to help or try calling Our
Hope (451-2039), which is an excellent woman's program.
The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome finds its highest rate among Indian women.
Why does this have to be? What you do does make a difference. You can
increase the chances of having a normal~althy child by making intelligent
choices about alcohol and drugs. Think about it, but don't feel as if you
are alone.

FEEL FREE TO CALL KIM AT THE INTER-TRIBAL COUNCIL AT 774-8331 FOR MORE INFORMATION OR AID.

A very special HAPPY BIRTHDAY to everyone who has a birthday in April.
HOPE YOUR BIRTHDAY WAS HAPPY to Les King who had a birthday in March.

And a big

Last month we mailed 1 ,400 copies of Turtle Talk. If you can use your imagination
for a moment, I would like you to think about what a project it would be to fold
1 ,400 ten page copies, staple them, label them and sort them by zip code. Then
they must be bound and counted. After this is done, they must be taken in person
to the post office. As you've probably guessed, this project takes much team work.
So this month I would like to thank the following people for making it happen.
Kareen Lewis, Marti Ramseyer, Kimothy Anderson, Jumbo Anderson, Sandy Whiteman,
Florence Babcock, Carl Hamilton, Charlie Korn, Bob Parkey and Tina McCall. Thanks
again for your help!!!!

If you have something you would like printed in the Turtle Talk, please call Rae

THE ORIGIN OF THE GRAND RIVER BAND OF OTTAWA INDIANS cont.
After 1776, British agents attempted to secure Indian allies in their battle
with the rebellious colonists. When Arendt Schuyler de Peyster, Commander at Fort
Mackinack, approached chiefs Short Ears and Ganteaux of the Grand River, they refused to leave their families, further suggesting the permanance of their settlements.8 It should be noted that since about 1750 the fur trader and adventurer
Charles Langalde had operated a fur post at the mouth of the Grand River. This
may explain the establishment of permanent Ottawa villages in the region--they no
longer found it necessary to go to the Straits to market their furs.
Other British reports offer additional proof that a large number of Ottawa
now regarded the Grand River as their permanent home base. In 1779, the sloop
Felicity under the command of Samuel Robertson was sent to the Grand River to seize
or destroy "all the grain grease & provision in that country" so that Americans led
by George Rogers Clark could not get them. Robertson sent an interpreter to a
village 10 miles from the mouth of the Grand, and in his report mentioned the presence of a Black trader known as Black Peter as well as a Frenchman, Hippolite
Chaboly and a Mr. Legons. He did not find the cache of grain that he sought.9
However, the existence of this grain is further proof that the Ottawa were dwelling
in the area during the summer growing season as well as in the winter.
Three years later, John Coates, a clerk for the Indian Department, filed an
enumeration of the Indians who came to Michilimackinac to trade. According to his
estimate there were as many as 500 families or 1200 to 1500 people living on the
"Grand River and Banks of Lake Michigan. 11 10
A 1786 document describes the Ottawa as living "along the south and east side
of Lake Michigan, beginning at the distance of eight leagues (20 miles) from Michi1 imackinac and extending nearly to the River St. Joseph." The document goes on to
say that these Ottawa are "the small remains of a numerous people" who can no longer
hunt because "no more animals remain to call us out to the woods. 11
After 1783, the area was officially controlled by the new government of the
victorious American revolutionaries. However, it was not until 1820 that Americans
began to exercise actual control. In the intervening years, the accounts of traders
in the area make it clear that the Ottawa occupied several villages along the
river, although they still made regular journeys to the north.
In 1790, Hugh Heward of the American Fur Company, kept a journal of a trip he
made down the Grand River on his way from Detroit to the Illinois country. He
arrived at the rapids of the Grand late in April and found a village at the head
of the rapids, where a trader named Alexander McKenzie resided. An hour further
down the river (probably in the area of present Grandville), he found a second
village. The next day, at the mouth of the ri~er, he arrived at another village
and the fur trading post of Charles Langlade.l
Two later reports bear further testimony to the separation of the Grand River
Ottawa from their bretre n to the north. An 1805 message from the "Ottawa of the
South" to L'Arbre Croche states "We were originally of one fire, and we wish to
come back again to you, that we may all derive heat from the same fire." The
response suggests that the separation had become full and complete.

cont.
"You took a coa 1 ... " responded the people at L'Arbre Croche, "now remain by your
own coal. 13 Seven years later John Hays prepared a report for Ninian Edwards,
Governor of the Illinois territory on the Indian villages of the region. Although
he did not give their locations, he reported four villages with a total of 200 men
on the Grand River.14 When one considers that each of these men represented a
family, the total Ottawa population of the area may have been three or fou.r times
larger.
Given the vagaries of these early efforts to estimate population, it is
reasonable to conclude that there were at least 750 to 1000 Ottawa living along
the lower Grand River when Joseph La Framboise and his wife Marie, and later Rix
Robinson and Louis Campau, along with missionaries like Issac McCoy, Leonare Slater
and Fr. Frederic Baraga arrived in the vangaard of permanent white settlers. With
their arrival, Indian occupation of the area entered a new stage. That unhappy
story is all too well known. Treaties in 1821 and 1836 extinguished Indian title
to the land, and the "removal" pol icy of the United States government attempted to
place woodland dwellers on the high--and--dry--plains of Kansas and Oklahoma. The
Ottawa resisted with any means available to them. The result was a dispersal that
today finds some of their number living in Kansas, others living in northern Michigan, and still others remaining near the Grand River. The final irony is that over
140 years later, American courts are still attempting to define the language of the
treaties and determine just compensation to the Ottawa for their land.

Someday My Children
I see them running
running fast
Hoping they won't fall down
but children must play
so if they fall
I'll pick them up from the ground
Their faces shining
happily
Like stars in the sky
But one day
They will leave
And, tears I'll start to cry
Though they'll be gone
And have family too
I wish they wouldn't go
But again one day
I will smile
When they make their children's
Hearts glow.
10/79 Kareen Lewis

Changes
We've been together four yea rs
I took your name
and beared your child
No other love could be the same
Together we have endured pain
Suffered in unfaithfulness
Cried tears of alcohol
Yet, still we love no less
Trying to find a new lifestyle
You signed a paper and went away
And 'though I know you'll be ~8~~
I miss you more each day.
Sometimes I'm scared of how you've
changed
And I wonder if you are too
If it's so much that you can't
return
Remember I've always loved you
2/5/80 Kareen Lewis

May your every path be lead by wisdom
And followed with strength.

HERBS FOR MEDICINE
Herbs can be loaded with vitamins, minerals, potent medical drugs,
or poisons, depending, of course, on how they are used or for what.
American Indians became very knowledgeable in using herbs for medicine.
For instance, the Ojibwa used wintergreen tea or chewed the berries for
headaches without knowing that it contained acetylsalicylic acid - aspirin.
Unless you know what you are doing and collect your own, herbs and
tinctures can be purchased at a good price at Harvest Health, an herb store
on the corner of Eastern and Burton in Grand Rapids.
The following are four herbs that are used for the problem of alcohol
abuse:
Angelica

A decoction* of the root, or several grains of the powdered root,
is an old remedy for developing disgust for liquor.

Cayenne - (A hot pepper) To wean away from liquor, combine a few drops of
tincture of cayenne (tincture of capsicum) and a few drops of
tincture of orange peel and water. A few grains of the pepper
may be added to hot herbal drinks for restorative and stimulative
action.
Chamomile -Chamomile tea is said to help offset some reactions to alcohol
drinking.
Watercress-Counteract postparty fatigue and alcoholic fumes by eating lots
of watercress. Watercress is also useful to offset the smell and
taste of smoking. The pure, pressed juice of watercress is
imported from Germany.

*To make a decoction simmer herb in almost boiling water for 30 minutes and
strain while hot. Never use cast iron, aluminum, or cracked enameled cast
iron.

SECTION 504 WORKSHOP
After all (39) of our participants were transported to the Grand Rapids
Inter-Tribal Council, a chartered North Star bus was boarded for a trip to
Chicago, Illinois for a workshop conducted by the Minority Enterprise Services
Associates (MESC).
MESC Corporation is an Indian owned company which was awarded a contract
by the office for Civil Rights and Administration for Native Americans to train
Native Americans (handicapped persons, advocates, tribal leaders and service
providers) in the rights of handicapped persons under Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 prohibits discrimination and guarantees
accessibility to programs which receive federal financial assistance.
The MESC staff conducted the training and technical assistance workshops
in areas legal and civil rights under Section 504.
Meals, transportation and lodging for disabled participants were paid for
by the MESC Corporation.
Certificates of training were presented to all participants upon completion of the training.
Respectfully submitted,

April 1, 1981
Dear President Reagan,
I am Sarah Pigeon, the wife of a Vietnam veteran. In these troubled times
drastic measures must be taken to save our economy. I can understand the need for
everyone to make sacrifices as government spending is brought under control.
However, I do not know how we as a nation can ask our veterans to make anymore
sacrifices for us. A nation needs its soldiers, but a nation that turns its back
on the veterans' needs may find itself without an effective army.
I would like you to take a few moments from your busy schedule and remember
as I do the sacrifices made by so many young men for this nation.

R E M E MB E R
The lights of the runway shimmered in my eyes as I tasted salt in my mouth.
They called it a war when he left. It was a war. The plane rose slowly like the
blade of a guillotine. It carried my heart.
He was a boy, not a man, a tall boy hidden in a uniform. I could still feel
the warmth of his arms around me. Would I ever feel them again, or would they soon
be cold and stiff.
Vietnam, where was it? I rushed home desperate to escape the great weight
that was descending on me. Where was it? Looking at a map of the world I saw the
small coastal country, but my mind couldn't imagine what it was like. I wanted to
picture it, to see where he was going.
I watched the evening news. I saw the reports on the war. I also saw the
reports on student demonstrations. I hated them for being here while he was there.
Vietnam. We'd been married three weeks. We'd been high school sweethearts
for four years. Jerry volunteered for the draft, just before the lottery began.
I wrote to him in Vietnam and told him his number had come up seven. My American
Indian husband had been destined to go. I wondered how his destiny would bring him
back, if he came back.
I'd seen so many that went, some didn't come back, others came back changed.
Helplessness is so suffocating. It weighs on you, frustrating and unrelenting. You
imagine the horrors of war and the innocence of the one you love. You can not
imagine the rape of that innocence even when the pictures and the letters come.
The pictures told more than the letters. Letters were attempts at being cheerful and reassuring. He tried to make love to me with his words, trying to fend off
the fear of infidelity, to be forgotten, Dear John, was an ultimate fear.
The pictures were remarkably good. They showed more of the stark reality.
Not by displaying violence, but by the obvious lack of it. It was a hot, dirty
place, a permanent camping out, in holes dug into the dusty ground.
One he sent, I'm sure, was to show me how cozy a bunker could be. It was a
samll hole big enough for two air mattresses. Displayed on them were pictures of
me in a small album, and a plastic bag that held the tattered lacy blue garter I'd
worn at our wedding. The walls and roof were sand bags.
I read the untold story in his pictures. The place was unlike anything he'd
ever encountered in his nineteen years of life. He had known harsh reality as an
Indian in a world that saw them still on horseback in old movies, massacring harmless white settlers, whose only crime was that they wanted the Native Americans
homelands.
But nothing before had the clarity that he faced as I saw it, looking at a
picture of a loaded ninety milemeter recoiless rifle. The rifle was ready. The
tripod held it just above ground level in the weeds. I gazed down the barrel at
the field of vision, blurred by a misty, indistinctness, the unknown. Would they
come or not? Did they? I don't know. I didn't dare ask in my letters.

!

There was a jargon that went with Vietnam that made it less understandable
to civilians and probably more bearable to the soldiers,
The trip on a helicopter to a possible ambush was an eagle flight on a chopper
to a "hot" L.Z. Things were graded from 1-10, 1 being good, 10 being "t:he worst.
The enemy was V.V. or NVA, the people in general were gooks. All this tried to
depersonalize the war, but there's something very personal about seeing the photograph of two youngsters standing next to a pole on which a human skull is stuck.
Your nineteen year old husband and his buddy and an NVA skull, that he explained
was to frighten the enemy.
He didn't send pictures that showed the blood and gore that is war, the news
media did that. He sent pictures of the cold equipment and the conditions in which
he lived.
It's funny because the real story was at first dimmed to me by my desire just
to drink him in as I opened each envelope hoping for pictures. To see he was alive
in the photograph, to count his arms and legs and look at his thinning figure, and
see he was still real, it was ecstatic. I didn't really begin to understand the
story in those pictures until much later.
The longer he was there, the bleaker the pictures became. Clowning stopped
soon to be replaced by pictures of things, a mountain, helicopter, bunkers, guns,
aerial shots, and men - men who were close. I asked for pictures of him, and they
came showing him gaunt, strained, lonely and afraid. I didn't see this at first,
I only saw that he was alive, but the longer I looked, the greater became my understanding.
It was very sobering to know that your future, your entire life is out of your
hands. It was an agonizing year and it became a part of me. The knowing that you
cannot control, you cannot effect, you must simply take it as it comes and hope for
the best. It taught me more about the condition of human life on our planet and how
insignificant you really are to everyone, but the few whose lives touch yours. It
also taught me how significant the Creator is in His ability to know each person
individually. It taught me the true meaning of trust and of luck.
My husband came home, some of his buddies didn't, some of my friends didn't.
He came home a man, a tormented man, who's seen mankind at its worse and knows the
fragility of the human body. He knew the fine intangible line between living and
being alive.
This is part of him, its affect will be with him always. He may not consciously
think of it everyday, but it's with him everyday for the rest of his life. He is one
of the many, who fought, as I am one of the many who waited. We cannot change what
was, only learn from it.
But we must learn from it as a nation, a nation that didn't forget 52 hostages
in Iran, and cannot afford to forget the Veterans of the war noboday wants to
remember. It was a war - a real war. Young men died. Young men were maimed. People
cannot erase their pain from the pages of history.
The Indian culture throughout America has always recognized the special understanding of life that comes to the warrior. The ultimate knowledge of life and
death, of giving and taking it. The veterans are all around us, their needs are
clear to those who want to see. We must take care of our warriors, we must, because it was a war we sent them to, a real war, and we are all responsible.
I watch my husband turn the pages in the album of Vietnam pictures. I see the
haunted look in his eyes as he remembers, and answers the curious questions of our
ten year old son. I watch and I wonder, when will I be asked to wait again, and
how will the father handle the waiting for the son?
Mr. President, the cost of the programs for the Vietnam veterans is an "earned
expenditure" that this nation cannot default. Pl ease save these much needed programs.
Respectfully,
Sarah Pigeon

TRANSCRIPT OF INDIAN FISHING RIGHTS STORY/2 Apr 81 WZZM
SAVAGE STAND UP OPEN: This Federal building in downtown Grand Rapids has been the
scene of a recrea t ion. Senior District Court Judge Noel Fox is trying to set the
scene around the signing of an 1836 treaty between the Federal Government and the
Indians. In it, Fox ruled that the Indians have retained aboriginal rights to
hunting and fishing. It was a trade off: land for a state for the resources.
SAVAGE: The 13th article
hunt on the land ceded by
in Article 3 that fishing
ruled those statues still
tures by Indians.

of the 1836 treaty retains the rights of the Indians to
the Federal Government. A second treaty of 1855 stipulates
rights were retained by an earlier treaty. Judge Fox has
stand today, up to and including commercial fishing ven-

LE BLANC:" ... because Indians were commercial fishermen long before the white man
came to this area. They traded, generally, with other tribes."
SAVAGE: Both LeBlanc and John Scott, Chief of the DNR's fishery division, feel
cooler heads should prevail. Both agree negotiations will settle the matter.
SCOTT: "At least we're talking. And, we're looking at ways and means by which
we might agree to a settlement at least in some facets of the treaty fishery."
SAVAGE: LeBlanc and Scott argue it will take years to settle the matter, and both
refused to speculate what that settlement could mean to either side. But both say
this vented anger from both sides is useless, since it's a matter of law for the
Courts.

ONCE THERE WAS YOU
For weeks r hurt all over
My eyes and every muscle
Yearned for sleep
At night sleep came hard
Holding only my pillow
And his memory
So distant
In my waking
I tried to force a smile
But the icilic grin faded
For there were no arms
To greet me Good-morning
Only tears

There is no time for fighting amongst ourselves now
Hold back your petty angers and selfish cries
Be strong in our ever growing circle of long life
In our battle for survival and lasting truth
Let me guide you through the unconditioning process
And re-learn life as it was first taught by Grandfather
We shall also phase out the English language
And learn our own once again
So untie your War-Braid
And draw back your bow and arrow
Make your new aim
The fight down the spiritual road

YOUTH IN GOVERNMENT

On April 9, 10 & 11, 1981, three of our native youth had the
opportunity to attend the 33rd Annual Youth In Government program at
our state capitol .
Youth In Government is one of the best programs offered to high
school students.

It is a state model legislative program where students

learn by participation, the entire state legislative procedure.

A

student learns how an idea becomes law and how laws can be changed.
Sessions were held in the House and Senate Chambers of the State Capitol
in Lansing.
If we, as an Indian people, are to influence our destiny, we need
to have an understanding of how the process works in regards to law
making and law amending.

Youth In Government provides this training.

The students received training in bill writing, campaigning for
the elections, learned rules of personal conduct and received a clear
overall view of what Youth In Government is all about.
The days were long.

We'd be up at 7:00 a.m., break for lunch at

noon and resume until about 5:00 p.m.

Other scheduled activities would

keep us moving until about 11 :00 p.m.

Of course it was not all work.

Friday night we had a dance that was well attended by all.
The students are looking forward to next year's Youth In Government.

A letter from the "Milwaukee Indian News"
Not long ago two young men were drinking in a bar and began quarelling
with each other. One left, went home and got a gun, returned and shot the other.
One is in jail, the other in the hospital.
More recently a group of young men were boozing while riding in a car.
The car went out of control, rolled over, injuring two, killing one. The driver
will be in jail for a long time.
These incidents got me thinking of all the otherwise good men who are
ruining themselves because of drinking and doping. But they're also ruining it
for all of us young women who are at an age of wanting to start families.
I am a young, healthy Indian woman of average intelligence, but I am alone
because I want a GOOD man to have my children with--and there aren't many around-at least not straight ones. Do I have to settle for a drunk? Or a doper??

Everyone seems overly concerned with statistics, that's true. But in playing
around with some figures I've come up with some scary numbers.
Every single day 22 teens are killed because of alcoholism. In the same day
110 teens are disfigured in some way because of the same reason.
From the time it may take to make and eat supper (1 1/2 hours), one youth and
maybe more will have been kill ed. In that same time about 7 youths will have been
maimed due to drinking. And that goes on every hour and one half a day.
Of course, you have to figure that Indian youths, both men and women, drink
more that whites (Indian male youths have a 42% drinking problem rate as compared
with 34% for Anglo males of the same age; and women are 31% compared to 25% Anglo).
This means that you can probably up the figures killed and maimed when you are
talking about Indian youth alcoholism.
Interesting--look around you, and take a look at yourself; are you planning
on being just another Indian statistic, or an Indian? Before Indians were statistics,
they didn't drink.

SUCCESS WITK GROWING VEGETABLES
Have you ever planted a garden? If you haven't you don't know what you are
missing. Last year I wanted to plant a garden, but everyone told me I couldn't
because the soil in my yard wasn't good enough. Did I fool them. With a little
determination I grew tomatoes, carrots, corn, radishes and lettuce. It was so
much fun to watch everything grow! And it was even more fun to serve MY HOME GROWN
vegees to my friends.
If you would like to give it a try here are a few suggestions to help you get
started.
l. Plants grow best in moist, enriched soil and under full sun.
2. Choose a sunny site within reach of a hose. Keep the area small.
3. Soil that's going to grow good food crops should not have shrub, tree or
other kinds of roots in it.
4. Avoid ground where puddles stand for days.
5. If you do not have a spot in your yard, rent a garden plot from Community
Education. You may call 456-4589 for the garden plot closest to your
home.
The right time to cultivate soil is when you can squeeze a fistful of it and
have it crumble again right away. If soil sticks together, wait until it gets
drier. If ground is too dry and hard, soak it to a depth of 6 to 8 inches, then
allow it to dry. Follow the following steps.
1.
2.

3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.

Strip sod or weed patch.
Cultivate soil.
Rake smooth.
Apply fertilizer.
Dig seed furrows.
Plant seed.
Cover seed.
Dig holes for transplants.
Soak soil.

After planting follow these directions.

7.

Water often.
Provide frost protection.
Thin the seedlings.
Stake plants early.
Lay mulch.
Get rid of weeds.
Fertilize.

WHEN PLANTING YOUR GARDEN
YOU MAY HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS.
DON'T HESITATE TO CALL A
PLACE SUCH AS FRUIT BASKET
OR MEIJERS. THEY WILL BE
HAPPY TO HELP YOU.
GARDENING IS GREAT FUN. WHY
NOT GIVE IT A TRY?

Happy Birthday to those who have birthdays in the sunny and delightful month of

May is a very busy time of year. We've been planning our adult graduation,
making arrangements for the graduation at the Civic, getting things ready for
the end of the school year and much much more. With all the activities going on,
I was worried the Turtle Talk would get to your homes late. But never fear, my
help was here!!! My special thanks to Jumbo Anderson, Elaine Mashka, Liz Wesaw,
Laura Burfield, Al is ha Anewishki, Sandy Whiteman, Texanna Root, Jeanette St. Clair,

STATEMENT OF PROGRESS ISSUED FOLLOWING
MEETING ON MICHIGAN INDIAN FISHING RIGHTS
Federal, State and Tribal leaders met in Washington on May 6 and 7 to seek
solutions to problems concerning the fishery in the northern Great Lakes off
Mi chigan's coastlines.
The group, composed of representatives of the Secretary of the Interior,
Mi chigan Governor's Office and Michigan Department of Natural Resources and
leaders of the Bay Mills, Grand Traverse and Sault Ste. Marie Tribes, issued
the following statement:
"These two days of meetings represent a good faith effort to solve the
problems relating to the Great Lakes fishery. The discussions proceeded fully
and frankly and the parties now have a greater understanding of each others
concerns. Substantial progress has been made in establishing a process which
will permit the achievement of an agreement protecting both the fishery
resource and the interests of the State and the Tribes. The participants
recognized that continued progress will require patience, understanding, and a
cooperative attitude among the citizens of Michigan.
"The group agreed upon the following course of action:
"l.

To continue initial progress with another meeting to be held in
Washington, D.C. on June 4 and 5.

"'l.

A working group of biologists from the State, Tribal, and Federal
governments was created to produce a report on the status of the
affected fishery resource. All parties will share, information with
the working group.
The report developed by the task force will provide the common base
of facts and projections necessary to derive and support future group
decisions.

Under

"3.

Another tripartite working group was created, headed by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, to examine factors_ related to some degree of
conversion from large mesh gill nets to roore selective fishing gear.

"4.

A tripartite working group, headed by a Tribal designee, will
the problem of access to fishing grounds.

"5.

The State of Michigan will work with the Tribes and other affected
groups to make necessary adjustments to the recently issued State
emergency fishing regulations assuming these regulations are put in
place by the Federal Court."

The meeting was attended by 22 persons.
Secreta~y William P. Horn.

'INDIANS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DEMISE OF FISH'
In regard to a recent Readertorial on gill net fishing by Jack Van Rhee, I
would like to comment.
Defensively, the majority is always quick to disclaim the racial implications
in such confrontations as the fishing issue.
The federal government was first to bring suit against the state of Michigan
in the name of the tribes involved. The courts found that in fact the Indians had
retained their aboriginal rights to hunt and fish in the areas named in the suit.
This included the use of the gill net, an ancient form of fishing.
One cannot ignore the perspectives that different groups use in viewing the
same problem. To say this is not a racial issue is to refuse to understand the
viewpoint of the Indians. Racial prejudice is a fact of their lives. That same
prejudice has stolen their lands through the Removal Act, trapped them on reservations and has denied them equal rights in all aspects of life.
How many rich Indian fishermen do you know, Mr. Van Rhee?
I have read Judge Fox's decision in detail and it is my opinion that the
sport fishermen are privileged to be allowed to fish at all! The Indians retained
their fishing and hunting rights. I believe that means they kept them for themselves.
It is embarrassing to hear the sportsmen covet the fishing rights of a few
people who have so little else. Indians use gill nets, an ancient tool and sportsmen use radar-sonar devices, known as fish finders. Ironic, isn't it?
The tribes involved always used fish as a trade item. It was their livelihood.
The Indians were not responsible for the demise of the fish. The enterprises
of white men were responsible: Uncontrolled and commercial fishing and the completion of the Welland Canal that allowed the sea lamprey into the Great Lakes.
Sportsmen are concerned because fishing license fees are $14.50. After all
fishermen, $14.50 for one fish dinner for a family is pretty cheap!
Oh, by the way, my husband is a sports fisherman.

Below is a letter we received from Brandi Hawthorne, 904 1/2 Plaza St., Clearwater,
Florida, 33515.
Dear Turtle Talk,
I have just found out that you publish the newsletter Turtle Talk. I would
like it sent to me.
I am of Apache blood and miss the surroundings of what I believe in, the
Indian nation.
It is lonely here, besides very few who believe as I do.
I would truly enjoy having the Turtle Talk sent to me and if some of you
would like to write to me that would be great.
I am also teaching, or trying to teach, myself about all nations and if there
is someone who wouldn't mind teaching me more it would put a smile on my face.
I am an artist and also do some writing.
I am sending you something I have written.
I hope you like it!
Thank you for your time.
May the "Great Spirit" watch over you.

In response to the letter from the 11 Milwaukee Indian News"
My thoughts and feelings are along the same line of thinking. I too, am
an Indian woman right here in Grand Rapids, Michigan, alone, simply because I
refused to go with a non-Indian person. And most of the Indian men that I know
either have a drinking problem, or their lives are already so complicated that
it would not pay to get involved with them. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing
wrong with an occasional drink now and then, but within limits, of course.
Many many of our Indian men are intelligent and, I might add, gorgeous but
they are usually "gung-ho" on being Indian and being involved as an Indian person,
but when they go their separate ways it is not an Indian woman that they share
their life with. It is a non-Indian. I am not comdemning anyone because you
cannot help who you fall in love with, but my question is, where does that leave
us Indian women who want and need a good Indian man? And visa versa?

DRUNKEN IS NOT INDIAN
Alcohol as a drinking institution is a white invention and not Indian. The
Indian drinks with Indian values, and the alcoholic rate for Indians is higher
than any other racial group. Remember, such values did not develop around an
easily gotten supply of strength liquor.
It is not Indian tradition that is at fault. Indian values in an Indian land
make a strong people. But in dealing with the white world and its alcohol something new must be learned; but the traditional values are still good, they can
still make a strong people.
Bravery was highly regarded at one time. The courage to recognize an enemy
and fight him. What greater enemy is needed than the alcohol that breaks up the
family, takes away your job, drains away your health and future and stops you from
being an Indian.
Alcohol can be friendly and warm, but so can fire.
Know how to control it.
Know how to fight it.
To understand or help you fight it, please call Kim Hoag or Bobbie Rosencrans
at the Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal Council. The number is 774-8331.

Mr. Wally Hall
Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal

Grand Rapids, MI 49504
Dear Wally,
It's kind of hard for me to comprehend where all the time has slipped
away to; we're a couple middle-aged Hopkins kids ~till out there flogging
away. I wouldn't have it any other way though. And I must thank you for
many things.
Your ' call to me at the Sault came at a time when I most needed it.
Your call and the organizing that you and Jirmny did down there in Grand
Rapids and Muskegon added that one. dimension that has always been missing
in our Michigan Indian meetings - you brought visual display of what
committment is to our Michigan folks. And your call came when some folks
were telling me why the "Teach Inn wasn't going to go. They couldn't hear
the EAGLE. I am indebted to you on two coun_ts.
As well as thanking you for your support I also want to commend your
leadership by example, the "don't do only as I say; but do also as I do"
model that is the basis of what E.A.G.L.E. is all about. Your youth became
men on that walk; they' 11 never be the same again. They learned about themselves and they cannot achieve this without a few adults taking leadership
responsibilities seriously. This is our station in life.
With your help we also promoted respect among the many different Indian
folks who came out to be with us. We Native people all have the common
denominator of our oneness with the Creation as our bond to each other no
matter l~w one dresses or worships. It was pleasing to feel our unity on
that May 7th day. Megwetch Wally, and Jimmy; you did your part to make our
people proud.
I'd like to have the Mi-gi-zi Drum come up to the Sault sometime in the
near future. We've got a lot of slides and tapes from the "Teach In" and we
could re-live it for some of our home town folks who couldn't make it down.
They need to hear the EAGLE as we do.
I'll close now, Megwetch.
Your

o~~other,

Bill Church

REPORT TO COALITION OF FEEDBACK FROM INDIAN MASS MAY 15, 1981
by Joe John
The Mass was attended by approximately 75-80 Indian persons.
--A number of Indians reported they were very pleased with the Mass.
--Some elders felt that the Medicine Lodge or Medewin Society would be appropriate
to use if it was followed step by step. Most local Indians are unfamiliar with
Medicine Lodge.
--It was noted that a number of older Indians who were baptized into the Catholic
Church who no longer attend felt uncomfortable in a church because they had been
away for so long. They indicated that it would be easier to attend a mass at a
public place such as Ab-Nab-Awen Park.
--One person who attended questioned whether a traditional Indian Mass and what
took place at the Mass was in keeping with the sacraments had been approved of
by the church.
--One elder noted that drums should have been incorporated into the liturgy.
--Several persons felt that Indian prayers and songs should have been offered in the
liturgy.
--A number of people did not attend or were confused because the site for the Mass
and date were changed several times.
Finally, I suggest it might be a good idea to ask Fr. Gardner to have a mass here
next in order that Indians might experience his approach of incorporating tradition
into the liturgy.

A TRIBUTE TO CHARLES (JUMBO) ANDERSON
How do we love you?

Let us count the ways!

Jumbo Anderson, a former Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal Council employee, has been, and
still is, our jack-of-all-trades. Because of the budget crunch Jumbo recently was
laid off from the Inter-Tribal Council, but because he is such a wonderful person,
still is around to help all of us who need him.
There is no way in the world we can thank him for all the things he does for our
staff and community, but we would like to let him know we appreciate him very much.
Jumbo is always there to pick up, help put together, and mail the Turtle Talk, to
fix staff cars, answer phones, pick up donations, move heavy items in a single bound
(that might be why his nickname is JUMBO), make coffee for staff and visitors, run
errands, always volunteers to help with special events, helps our custodians, and
is always willing to help our seniors. Jumbo is always cheerful and full of sparkle.
He keeps the staff on their toes. He's always willing to help.
So, Jumbo, again, thanks.
by all.

Your energy, enthusiasm, and friendliness is appreciated

June 12, 1981
Many thanks to all who promoted the Indian mass on May 15, 1981, at St. Mary's Church.
And all that participated in any way to welcome Fr. John Haskell, the mass celebrant.
Also thanks to Fr. John for accepting the invitation and driving somewhere near 600
miles to celebrate with us, even though he became ill on the way and had to stop to
rest for three hours. It would have been much easier and much closer to turn back.
Grand Rapids was blessed in a special way that day. I was especially blessed. As I
seek to learn more of my ancestrial ways, although I could not understand all that
was done, I sensed one thing for sure, a very sacred and holy presence existed and
that could only be the presence of the Great Sptrtt!
I know now that my search is not worthless or in vain and I was encouraged to continue
and not give up.
I hope someday to learn about the traditional in the mass and that it will be respected soon and that I will be able to take part in this most beautiful and unusual
eel ebration.
Thanks again

TUBERCULOSIS
WAKE UP TO THE FACTS!
TB STILLS REMAINS A SERIOUS DISEASE. Best estimates suggest 16 million Americans are
infected - have live TB germs in their bodies. Unfortunately, most of these infected
persons do not know they are infected. Annually about 30,000 break down with ACTIVE
disease.
Anyone can get TB. Tuberculosis spreads from person to person. Persons with active
TB cough or sneeze germs into the air.
A simple skin test can show whether you have the TB germs in your body, even when there
are no signs of disease. A small amount of harmless material is placed between the
surface layers of the skin, usually in the forearm. If you have picked up the TB gem,
a redness or swelling will appear at the test spot within 48 to 72 hours.
Today the infected person is treated. This treatment is to prevent the TB germs from
becoming active and doing lung damage some time in the future.
People who should get TB tests regularly are: those who are in contact with a person
found to have active TB, diabetics, those with chronic chest conditions such as asthma,
chronic bronchitis, emphysema, dust diseases or "cigarette cough", persons making
poor or slow recovery from flu or pneumonia, persons suffering from lung cancer.
TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM TB: 1. Have a TB skin test periodically 2. See your doctor
tf your TB skin test is positive 3. Follow your doctor's advice if you are placed
under treatment.
FOR MORE INFORMATION: CALL THE KENT COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR
SUGAR IN READY-TO-EAT CEREALS
Sugar plays several important roles in the formulation of both non-ready-sweetened
cereals such as Kellogg's Corn Flakes and ready-sweetened cereals such as Kellogg's
Sugar Frosted Flakes of Corn.
On the average, a one-ounce serving of Kellogg's non-ready sweetened cereal contains
about one level measuring teaspoon of sugar. An equivalent weight of a ready-sweetened
cereal contains another one to three measuring teaspoons of sugar. The amount of
sugar added to ready-sweetened cereals is based on the results of consumer taste panels.
Research has indicated that the amount of sugar added to ready-sweetened cereals by the
manufacturer is about the same as that commonly added from the sugar bowl to the nonready-sweetened varieties.

NOTE:
Again, I would 1ike to take a minute to thank Duane Raphael for al 1 his help in
drawing pictures for the Turtle Talk. Even though school is out for the summer,
Duane has been around to help. His drawings seem to give the newsletter a whole
lot of character. So, again, thanks Duane.

INDIAN EDUCATION
As a result of the "Walk for Support of Education" to Lansing, in May
of 1981, which involved Native American youth from various parts of Michigan,
they were given a special honor by the Sault Ste. Marie Indian Education Dept.,
put together by Bill Church.
June 12, 13, 14, titled "Indian Awareness Weekend" was made available
to honor the youth for their participation and efforts in the meaningful 1 wal k'
to the capitol grounds in Lansing.
Our youth left here on Friday, June 12, on their way to enjoy the
festivities. The youth engaged in three days of cultural living and learning
and were presented with tokens of appreciation for their efforts, given free
meals, enjoyed a drumming ceremony, social activities at Rotary Island, a
ferry ride to Mackinac Island at which the youth participated in their annual
"Lilac Festival Parade". Mi-gi-zi Drum was the honored drum and was given
expense money to attend along with a fee for the drummers.
Mr. Bob Van Alstine, Superintendent of BIA was also there in attendance,
along with other dignitaries of the area.

"Our prophecies say a time of struggle is coming, people who know how to
live on the land will survive."
"People are always talking about being rational, but if you look at the
whole situation of the world today, it's not very rational. So we're the mystics
and the dreamers and the idiots because we listen to our elders, because we
respect our children, because we hold the earth sacred, because we keep wanting
to share everything and can't quite get the hang of this materialistic society because we don't worship Progress, with a capital P."
"But I believe that in the end, it will be the people who love this land,
who know how to live on it in a loving and reverential way and spiritual way,
who will survive on it. If we survive at all."

A Voice of the Three Fires
Sixty-seven years ago, Pe-nay-se (Little Brother of the Eagle) was
sent away to Wisconsin to learn and study in the ways of his people. He
became a peace chief, a holder and teacher of the spiritual beliefs of
the Three Fires people. But it would be a long time before he could pub1 icly teach those beliefs.
Indian religion was outlawed in 1921. It was not until President
Carter signed the Freedom of Religion Act in 1978 that Pe-nay-se (English
name, Erving Romans) was able to spread his knowledge.
Today, Erving Romans is 71 years old and the youngest of the three
remaining peace chiefs (the eldest passed away last fall). But Erving's
years do not show on him and his voice is as strong as his spiritual beliefs.
On July 15 and 16 at 10:30 in the morning, he spoke at the InterTribal Council concerning the Peace Shield, the Spiritual Lodge, and the
Seven Fires Prophecies. He was invited to come by the Substance Abuse Program,
but his message was a voice from the past: The basic spirituality of Indian
people.
The word "basic" should be emphasized. The spiritual base of the Three
Fires people goes beyond tribe or nation or even Christianity, for it is the
same for all--yet it is Indian. Erving does not teach the old way~ as much
as he teaches the spirituality that made the Indian strong, and he does so
in accordance to Christian spirituality.
The following was written by Pe-nay-se and contains a little of the
message he brought to the Council on the 15th and 16th, but it is still
only a small part of the teachings he has to spread. If you missed Pe-nay-se
this time, he will be coming back in September and again, hopefully, in the
winter. We will try to keep you posted through the "Turtle Talk" but he may
be coming on short notice. If you do not wish to miss him, call 774-8331.
Kim, Bobbie or Phil will take your name, number and address so they will be
able to let you know.

I)

As we gather here to search for the truth, we can hear the anguished
cry of the Ancient Ones. You can argue with the data and conclusions, if
you like, but first look into the past. Those who do may see many truths
and look at their own lives with a new feeling of the Ancient Ones and their
heritage.
The Indian, before the coming of the White Man, did not have to ask
himself, "who he was", because he knew for eons of time. His Mother was
the earth and the Great Spirit was his Father, and all things had the same
Mother and Father. But Man was different than the rest of the creation on
earth in the fact that he had a determining spirit, which through the
illumination of the Morning Star (the reflection of the Great Spirit) gave
him the power to overcome his failures, for his Spirit came from1he Great
Spirit.
All things knew how to live in harmony with the universe, except man,
because all creation except man knew how to give away. The trees were given
to the animals and man for their protection, etc. The grasses furnished food
for man, animals, birds, etc.
He also knew that there were two men in each man. The Spiritual man had
to conquer the physical man. Each man was born with a gift of one of the
four directions. Not all men had the same gift. By learning to give this
gift to his brother he began to travel on the circle of life, which is to become a whole person.
For all people were the same in only one way. That was their loneliness.
Loneliness is the cause of our wars, greed, hate, love, compassion, etc.
So to become in harmony with the universe, he had to learn to give. Not
just materially, which comes from the physical man, but to give of himself
from the Spiritual man. When all people did this the circle of life became
the flowering tree. A universal harmony of all people and the Great Spirit's
Creation. And this all came about because the Great Spirit is the presence of
the total and the breath of wisdom and love.
Some people try to accomplish this through other ways. Some through
Wisdom, which is one way of learning. But the nature of man's wisdom is to
steal the Star Water. Others through innocence.
But man's nature of
innocence is to trick, to obtain the Star Water. Looking within or researching
is another way. But men frustrate their own introspection and come to the
Star Water by force. The fourth way was walked by the people who looked to the
east, the true way.
The Star Water is understanding, mercy, kindness, love, truth, joy, etc.

May 11 , 1981
To The Editor,

Re: an article, "Indian Youth Cry for Unity", written by Keith Gave that
ran on May 8, I am deeply disappointed.
Mr. Gave focused attention away from the point of the "teach-in", demonstrating support for PA174, to a questionable abstract in the first six paragraphs. The point was, ironically, clearly visible in the accompanying photograph, in which placards proclaimed, "We Need PA174". PA174 is the tuition
waiver.
Youth's impetuosity is often inspired by a deep passion to change the
"world". Changing things outside oneself may appear easier at times than
changing what lies inside. Enthusiasm toward this end may sometimes lead to
comments about older generations. The intentions of the young men quoted were
honorable.
It is unfortunate that your newspaper choose to use their naivete to make
it appear otherwise. Your actions in this matter were at the least irresponsible,
at the worst manipulative.
Mr. Gave cannot defend his reporting as being sincere, unbiased, or accurate.
He wrote with obvious sarcasm about the wisdom the young men "claim" to have.
He did not believe them. His article did nothing, but perpetuate the sterotypic
image that the majority see as "Indian".
He made no mention of the main speaker for the event, Phillip Deere, who
is an internationally recognized spiritual leader. His travels have won him
respect from Washington D.C. to Geneva, Switzerland.
The headline "Indian Youth Cry for Unity" was misleading. The people were
united in pursuit of approval by the legislature of PA174, the tuition waiver.
Reading further, the article does explain about federal educational funding cuts
and that the tuition waiver may preserve educational opportunities for Indian
students that would otherwise be lost. It even explained how the state government
enacted the tuition waiver, but neglected to appropriate funds for it.
However, Mr. Gave, through the first six paragraphs assured that most white
readers would not continue beyond that first impression. Having their sterotypes
reenforced, they would stop reading assuring themselves that what they had
believed was true after all.
You did not have to bend over backwards to slant the story in favor of the
Indians, you had only to report it with a discerning, responsible attitude. You
choose not to. I wonder if local issues, such as a charge filed with the Civil
Rights Commission concerning whether the annual Lansing Pow Wow will be held in
Grand Woods Park or not, had anything to do with it?
Lansing is the seat of government in this state. If Native Americans cannot
get responsible and accurate press coverage from the sole newspaper for Lansing,
how can they get fair treatment from the government officials your paper speaks
to. You have an even higher responsibility to the Cannons of Journalism, because
you represent the capitol, and the press has an extreme amount of power to influence public opinion.
Whether this interpretation of the "teach-in" was a deliberate attempt to
manipulate public opinion or whether it was simply a mistake made through insensitivity, does not matter at this point. What you have done has harmed an
honorable people. The Nishnawbe have become used to this kind of treatment. If
your intentions were not deliberate, than I call upon you as Journalists endowed
with a public trust to correct it, and actively seek not to make this kind of
mistake again.
Fair treatment in your newspaper is not so much to ask, is it?
Respectfully,

Man and Woman
by Sarah Pigeon
Fill up my days, embrace my nights.
Sweet love flows like nectar for the bees.
You quench my thirst, I overflow.
We wash away as sand and water.
The sky's height can't contain our depth
As dandelion fluff on wind's passionate breath.
The Bum
by Sarah Pigeon
He sits on the curb, brown bag in hand,
Tattered and used by his fellow man.
A bum, some say, a wino, a drunk.
He's wasted his life, he's only junk.
Useless, worthless, how can this be?
When he 1 s such a good lesson for you and me?
As he lifts .the brown bag with the bottle inside,
He pays for our lesson and the price is quite high.
Would you take his place so that others might learn?
Or is this an "honor" that most would spurn?
His life has a meaning, a purpose, a truth,
He's a marker of paths for the blindness of youth.
Being
By Sarah Pigeon
Lifetimes are crystal moments strung upon the thread of time.
Fragile, glassy beads of being, the Rosary of His mind.
Each bead a gem as pure as light, this substance we call life.
The whole immeasurable work of art, precious beyond price,
Appearances
by Sarah Pigeon
See me, I am but an image in your mind.
For what I am , you can not see and what you see does not exist.
I do not reside here on the outside, but buried deep within.
You must work to know me as I would work to know you.
Funny isn't it?
That what appears to be, is not; and what is, appears not.
Therefore, we must not trust our eyes.
We must know each other as though we are without sight.
Truly in the dark, searching for the light in each other.

but also of residents of the total City of Grand Rapids,
The City of Grand Rapids now faces the hard real ityl of declining
local revenues, further aggrevated by the reality of decreasing Federal

our City Government to adopt austerity budgets with potentially substantial
reductions in muni'cipal services. Very difficult decisions related to our
city~s government lay ahead and the First Ward, and the city of Grand Rapids,
need someone who is in touch with the people, encouraging their input as to
the maintenance of Essential Services vital to the quality of urban life
and the economtc and residential neighborhood vitality. As a city Commissioner, I will strongly support closer cooperation and mutual support of
other local governmental units of those services of this city which are used
by residents throughout our county. I will also devote my attention to improving relations between City Government and it's uniformed and nonuniformed workforces. As the campaign progresses, I will be issuing position papers elaborating on these and other issues.
I am a life-long resident of the West Side of Grand Rapids, graduating
from Union High School in 1967. I attended Grand Rapids Junior College for
two (2) years and have taken couse work at Grand Valley State Colleges and
Western Michigan University. I also hold a Social Work License from the

SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM

The staff of the G.R.I.T.C. Substance Abuse program was really glad
about the big turn out for the potluck we held in July. We had nearly 75
people in attendance and saw a film on alcoholism in an Indian family. It
was a positive evening with lots of happy faces. We hope to do this again
soon.
Also in July we had a visit from Erving Romans an elder from the upper
peninsula who taught some of the basics of traditional beliefs. Erving will
pass through Grand Rapids again this fall and we will ask him to teach again.
The following is a schedule of the Speaker's series we have starting in
July. Everyone is invited to come and hear what these good people have to
share with us.
July 23, 1981, Bob Stone from Muskegon 7:00 p.m.
"Does Alcoholics Anonymous work for Native Americans?"
July 30, 1981, Mary Swanson, Ottawa, head nurse at the Care Unit
"The path to healing an alcoholic"
August 6, 1981, Robin Johanson, Mt. Pleasant Indian Commission, 7:00 p.m.
"What can families do to deal with alcohol and drug problems"
AND
Ed Whitepigeon speaking on
"Indian Identity and Traditional Christian Values"
August 13, 1981 7:00 p.m. Jane Jawahir, medical doctor
"Can your baby be born an alcoholic?"
(This will also be a rap session for women on how to take care of their
bodies, especially during pregnancy. It will be a good chance to just
talk informally with a doctor.)
August 20, 1981 7:00 p.m. Mike Smith, Project Rehab Counselor
"What everyone should know about street drugs"
We hope we'll have a good turn out for these programs and would like to
hear from people about the speakers they'd like to hear. Also watch the Turtle
Talk for the date of our next potluck dinner and for a film series we have
planned.
GROUPS STARTING ... JOIN A CIRCLE OF CONCERN
Beginning the second week in August, Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal Council
will offer the chance for Native people to get together in small groups to
give and receivP help and knowledge in our struggle against alcohol and other
drugs. In these groups there will be an agreement that what is said is confidential and who is there is private. You do not have to have a drug problem
to attend. We only ask that those who come are honest in their desire for
help or to help. And, we will do all we can to see to it that everyone feels
welcome and accepted and knows they are not alone as they face this problem in
our community.
SCHEDULE IS FOUND ON REVERSE PAGE

SUBSTANCE ABUSE

QOn;t.

Monday noon to 1 :00 p.m.
Starting August 10 a Circle of Concern group for all who wish to come.
Perhaps we'll make it a sack lunch group or what ever people would like. In
this group you will find others who will offer their support in your search.
Wednesday 10:00 a.m. to noon
Starting August 12 there will be a Circle of Concern group for women
where a wide variety of topics will be discussed relating to the needs of
Native women today. This will also be a place where women can gain support
for their own search and struggles. {We can provide child care if needed.
Please call the Substance Abuse office if needed.)
Wednesday 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Starting August 5 we'll offer some fun activities for young people to
get together and learn some things about the fundamentals of sports. There
will be some teaching and playing of basketball, weight lifting and other
sports. Just the thing to get in shape for the fall sport's schedule. The
activities will change every few weeks so watch Turtle Talk for coming events.
We'll try to round up some tickets for some sport's events also so youngsters
can see first hand what they're learning. Along the way there will be some
learning about what is healthy for young bodies.
COME ON AND JOIN IN! Not just everything we develop from this department of
G.R.I.T.C. will focus just on substance abuse but we will be a place where
you can deal with those problems. WE PLAN TO HAVE FUN WHILE WE'RE AT ALL
THIS AND WE THINK YOU WILL TOO.

WE'RE VERY PROUD
Big surprises can come in small packages. One such is Elizabet h Pi geon, 7,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jerry (Butch) Pigeon of Holland.
Elizabeth was the winner in the girls fancy dance category 6-12 at the
Keewenaw Bay Pow-wow in Barage July 24, 25, and 26. Her prize was a wa tch, just
right for a small wrist.
Miss Pigeon has been fancy dancing since the Lansing Pow-wow 197 9. Her
participation has increased and been rewarded with her win at the Muskegon Pow wow last fall when she placed first. She took third place at the Three Fires
Pow-wow this summer.
Fancy dancing is just one form of Elizabeth's dance
expression, she has also studied ballet for two years.
Elizabeth's enthusiasm is a delight to her parents
and grandparents as expressed by her paternal grandfather, Ed Whitepigeon of Lansing. Elizabeth is the
great, great, great, great, great granddaughter of
Wah-be-me-me, for whom White Pigeon Michigan is named.
Elizabeth's dancing has become a family project.
Her aunt, Julie Pigeon of Kalamazoo, gave her the beadwork and initial instruction. Her mother, Sarah, made
her ribbon dresses. Her paternal grandmother, Virginia
Pigeon of Kalamazoo made her long-desired, fringed
shawl and her father, Butch , made her leather work.
It is through this support of family and friends
that Elizabeth is learning about tradition. It is .through the enthusi asm of t he
young that tradition is kept alive.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM
A Time for Moving Forward ...
The Substance Abuse Program is now in full swing offering services and
activities to the community.
Louise Medawis is leading groups, a Circle of Concern, Mondays at 9:30 a.m.
and Wednesdays at 7:00 p.m. The groups deal with AA attitudes, but in
traditional ways. They are for both men and women and will be held at the
Council in room 7.
Phil Memberto is a new staff member and counselor with the program. He
will be having many youth activities going on through the year. Presently, he
is having weight lifting and sport films on Wednesdays at 6:30 p.m.
Erving Romans, the spiritual teacher and elder, will be here the first
week in September. Call Phil or Bobbie at 774-8331 to find the exact time.
He is a man of much wisdom and should not be missed.
Look for us to bring you the films "Windwalker" and "I Will Fight No More
Forever" in the near future, probably around the first week in November. Both
films have Native American cast in positive and truthful ways. Both also have
Nick Ramus in the cast who plays twins in the extraordinarily beautiful film,
"Wi ndwa 1 ker" .
Lastly, I am moving on. It has been a good year. I have met many whom
I respect and I have learned a great deal. I thank everyone for giving this
year to me.

AUSTERITY PLAN
for the
KENT COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM, INC.
submitted by: Joe John
In realistically considering the funding outlook, it is the position of the
Kent Community Action Program to immediately implement the following
recommendations.
1.

To reduce the number of Neighborhood Centers; specifically,
to close the Franklin Hall Complex, the East Kent Center, the
Cedar Springs Center and the North East Complex with the
possible option of maintaining the North East Complex if a
rent-free arrangement can be worked out with the City of
Grand Rapids. We propose to maintain the Sheldon Complex and
the West Side Complex.

2.

To maintain program Administration functions at the Central
Office (550 Cherry Building) and to establish a Mobile Service
Delivery System utilizing the experienced staff to work in the
out-county areas from the Central Office.

3.

To continue Weatherization Program operations from the Madison
Center.

4.

To reassess Central Office and total staff activities.

5.

To reassess Neighborhood Center staffing.

6.

To reassess the absolute need for certain jobs; for example,
six Job Developers, six Volunteer Coordinators, a Purchasing
Agent, a Property Clerk, an Administrative Aide, and two
Bookkeepers.

7.

To reassess the present telephone system.

8.

To reassess inter-agency staff linkages.

9.

To freeze all salaries at their present level until September 30,
1981.

10.

To revise the agency's office hours; for example, to consider
reducing daily work hours to redirect portions of funds otherwise
going for payroll expenses.

11.

To actively recruit the volunteers necessary to supplement program
efforts.

12.

To escalate efforts aimed at revenue generating activities.

LITTLE ELK
by: Sarah Pigeon

He's a basket weaver, a maker of toys.
He creates beauty, he gives us joy.
An elder who's seen the coming rebirth,
The children returning to Mother Earth.
His wisdom is quiet, his smile meek.
In native language our prayers he speaks.
The elders are our treasure, they have much to give.
We must accept what they offer, while they live.

A Last Tribute to Toby - A Man's Best Friend
The Indian community of Michigan was saddened to learn of the death of a
true hero, Toby, a Shepard mix dog, who served his blind master, Joe John, as
a Leader Dog and faithful companion for the past 13 years. Toby, who was born
in 1966, and passed into the spirit world August 7, 1981, and Joe were assigned
together March 22, 1968, at the Leader Dog School in Rochester, Michigan.
Joe John, an elder and respected Indian leader throughout the State, and
Toby were a familiar sight wherever Indians gathered to socialize, promote Indian
rights or causes for the advancement of the socio-economic status of the Indian
people. One would find Toby together with Joe in many places where one doesn't
expect to see a dog. At all types of Indian meetings all over the state, Pow Wows,
Fishing Rights Trials, the Museum, Library, Indian centers, Indian lodge, Mt.
Pleasant Government Indian Schools' Annual Reunion, leading Joe in protest marches
around the State Capitol Building in Lansing, or at meetings of the Michigan
Commission on Indian Affairs, there would be Toby laying beside Joe's chair, uncomplaining and patient, for hours and hours. If Toby could have talked, believe
me, he could have told more about Treaties, Census Rolls, Indian rights, Indian
education, Indian needs, and the prejudices suffered by our people than most of us
could. Over the years, he was there observing and quietly listening.
Toby was no stranger to prejudice either. Twice while Joe, Toby and I traveled
together on Indian business, we were refused service unless we left Toby outside.
Once in Portland and again in Allegan County. The owners of these restaurants soon
learned, after Joe signed a complaint against them through the Association for the
Blind, that this is an offense punishable by a $100 fine.
When attending the two day Fishing Rights Trial in the County Courthouse in
Leland, Michigan, a court guard attempted to stop us from entering the court room
stating, "No dogs are ever allowed in there!" Joe replied, as we pushed right past
him with Toby in the lead, "Just step aside, sonny, this dog has been in more court
rooms than you are years old!" While the guard never took his eyes off us throughout
the two day trial, he didn't bother us again.
Toby endeared himself to everyone who knew him. He was well known on the
streets of "River City", as he took his daily stroll from their home on Lafayette,
S.E., to the Cottage Bar. There, while Joe visited with his many friends, Toby was
treated to the leftovers from yesterday's menu. It was amusing to watch them as they
made their way across town. Without a mistake or misstep, Toby led Joe through the
traffic and pedestrians. He knew just where to turn in, whether it be the Museum,
Library, or wherever Joe wished to go.
When an Indian has accomplished some special service for his people or his
country, his people honor him by awarding him a much cherished sacred Eagle feather.
Toby was a warrior who had surely earned his, but being a dog, never received it.
I, for one, believe he has his now, plus other rewards due him, where he romps
happily in that "Beautiful Hunting Ground'', free from the pain and illness of this
past year. There he has rest, peace and plenty, "in that land where the bright
waters shine".
Our sincerest sympathy to Joe and Hazel in the loss of truly a "Best Friend".
Only another animal lover can understand. Toby will be missed by all of us. He
was part of our Indian community. When one part is missing, we all feel the pain.

Toby was a real "Indian Dog,"
A Loyal, Faithful Friend.
He earned his place in Dog Heaven
Where his rewards shall never end.

Editor of Turtle Talk
Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal Council

Grand Rapids, MI 49504
Dear Editor:
As one of the Michigan delegation who attended the Tekawitha Conference in
Albuquerque, New Mexico last August, I was delighted to see Mary Simonait's perceptive article on the conference. It was both factual and sensitive and awakened
in all those who went from the Diocese of Grand Rapids fond memories of the trip.
It helped me condense my own feelings and views which I have set down in the
attached article. I hope you can find a place for it in your next issue.
Thank you.
Shirley Francis
P.S. Thanks to the Catholic Human Development Office of the Diocese of Grand Rapids
and its director, Dennis Sturdevant, six persons were able to attend the Tekawitha
Conference. They were: Grace Mulholland (Ottawa), Mary Simonait (Chippewa), Regina
Hudson (Chippewa), Ron Yob (Ottawa), George Francis (Chippewa) and Shirley Francis.
Megwetch, Dennis
INDIAN AND CHRISTIAN:

IS IT POSSIBLE?

The early 1970's were years of conflict for Native Americans as many were
drawn to the militant "Red Power" groups that sprung up all over Indian country.
These groups yearned to return to traditional Indian ways and religion.
Although many Indians, raised as Christians, continued to practice more conservative ways, they had to fight feelings of guilt as they were labeled "Uncle
Tomahawks" by their mil it ant brothers and sisters.
Both groups suffered. However, it was the new traditionally-oriented group
that suffered the most as they longed for the old ways only to be continually frustrated in tneir efforts. The elders they sought to follow were a disappointment;
many had grown up and gone to school in the days when B.I.A. policy was to send
Indian children to federal Indian schools that forbid them not only to speak their
native languages but also forbid them the practice of native religion and traditional
cultural ways as well. It was during this period of their life that many of them
adopted the Christian religion since the B.I.A. contracted with Christian denominations to operate these schools.
Many young militants were frustrated in their attempts to seek out and restore
the old ways by the inability to find sources of information on original Indian life
styles. Some sought to find answers in books only to find more frustration, heartllr0;1k and hi tterness . 13ooks like Dee 13rown 's 13_u_ry_ _My__H_e_~_t__2!1_ !-J_o_u__!1i_~_~_n_e~_ and
Glori s Jahoda's Trail of Tears may have pricked the consciences of whites, but they
opened afresh Indian wounds of anguish and despair as they read of the sufferings of
their ancestors.
At pow wows and other Indian gatherings during the mid 1970's, problems of the
militant group were compounded when relief was sought by some in drugs and/or
alcohol.

Thus, anguish, bitterness, depression and despair seemed to be the fruits and
rewards of the search for Indian identity, of the desire to find the ideal Indian
way. All of this bottomed out in the late 1970's. For some, suicide was the answer.
Others left white spous.es for Indian mates. Others ended up in small communities
deep in the reservations or entered hospitals or treatment programs. But others
turned toward more positive solutions. Indian schools and Indian controlled school
boards sprang up during this period. Indians began to run for offices in their
communities, tribal organizations and urban centers. The high school dropout rate
went from 63% in 1968 to 9.5% in 1979 in one area. Indians stayed in school or
returned to school and stayed on to graduate. Indian professional organizations
began to grow and thrive as Native American nurses, doctors, engineers and tribal
chiefs used their skills to bring about today's Indian lifestyle. A new brand of
Indian parents came on the scene - articulate, vocal and adamant about getting the
best education for their children beginning with Head Start for their preschoolers
and ending with college programs responsive to Indian needs.
This new sense of purpose and direction has also taken plBce in Indian
religious thought as it was realized that traditional religious ways must grow or
adapt to today's challenge if it is to meet the needs of today's Indian, just as
Christianity has had to do over the last 2,000 years.
At the Tekawitha Conference it was apparent that many Indians are re-examining
the Catholic Christian faith. But they are also emphatic that they can't use a
"White Man"/European Christianity. Over and over I heard that what was wanted and
needed is the Way of Jesus as it fits Indian life. The theme of this year's conference was "The Emerging Native American/Eskimo Catholic Church." Over 800 Indians
and Eskimos from across the country addressed this theme. What was surprising was
that the bishops and missionaries are listening. What a far cry from the missionaries
of 100 years ago who equated being Christian with living in a frame house (instead of
a wigwam or teepee}, singing hymns in English and using a plow (instead of huntingJ.
Even five years ago the Tekawitha Conference drew as little as 50 persons,
48 Catholic missionaries and two Indians. But these two spoke out. They wanted to
know why they didn't have a voice in the conference, why more Indians weren't invited. Msgr. Paul Lenta, Director of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions happened
to attend that conference. That had to be Divine Providence for he offered to fund
some part of the next year's conference if more Indians were invited. Two years ago
200 Indians attended and last year 800 made it to the conference. And more and more
wanted to know why they didn't have more active roles in the planning and implementing
of each conference. This year, Joe and Peggy Savilla, A Pueblo Indian couple were
the local coordinators of the conference. Their son, Father Ed Savilla, had a prominent role in its planning as did many other Native American Catholic clergy, Sisters
and 1ay people.
One of the most inspiring moments for me was the Communion se vice conducted by
the permanent deacons, all of them Indian. A permanent deacon in the Catholic Church
is a married man who prepares himself to serve Jesus and the Church through three to
five years of study. His wife also studies with him. He is able to baptize, marry,
hold communion services and preach, but does not offer mass or hear confessions.
Deacon Victor Bull Bear, a Sioux from a North Dakota Reservation, serves as pastor of
his Indian community. Due to the shortage of priests in his area, he conducts
regular Sunday services except for the mass once a month by a visiting priest. Deacon
Victor speaks fluent Lakota having learned English only four years ago. The Deacon
program for American Indian men is one of the church's answers to the request for
more responsiveness to the needs of Indians. A seminary for training young Indian
men for the priesthood is also being planned. Throughout the conference, Pueblos,
Comanches, Yaquis, Blackfeet, Crow, Chippewas, Navajos and many other tribes sounded
the cry for a church responsive to Indians.

"We want to follow the Great Spirit, but not as the white man does. For the Great
Spirit came to us too. He came to us long before the white man of Europe even heard
of Him."
And every community of Indians has found an Indian way to follow Jesus with the
blessing of their local bishop and priest.
Nor is Christianity new to some Indians.
The day long visit to the Santo Domingo Pueblo by the Tekawitha Conference delegates
was an enlightenment to most. Santo Domingo was named by the Spanish explorer,
Conquistedore Coronado, who came to the pueblo 300 yea , s ago. In spite of the hardships brought by the Spanish, the Pueblo Indians adopted the Catholic faith. The day
we were there was the Feast Day of St. Dominic. Along with the mass offered by Archbishop Robert Sanchez, there was celebration in true Pueblo fashion by the people.
About 1,000 people of the village spent the entire day dancing beautiful traditional
Pueblo dances. All men, women and children from preschoolers through teens were
dressed in their native symbolic clothes of the Turquoise and Squash Blossom Moieties.
It was a beautiful cloudless day with temperature hovering at about 100 degrees. But
the people danced on and on, first in front of the church (originally built in 1603)
and then between the two kivas on the plaza. The Pueblo people (they have 19 villages
in New Mexico) have successfully wedded their ancient ways with Christian belief and
practice. Nor are they "Uncle Tomahawks". They have simply learned "not to throw
the baby out with the bathwater", but to cherish what is good while ridding themselves
of the harmful effects of Spanish domination.
In meeting after meeting at the conference I heard similar expressions. For a
balanced, whole Indian life, one cannot live on bitterness, hatred, anger and frustration. Rather, wholeness and healing can only come from being fed on the food
that Jesus came to bring mankind - the food of love, kindness, thankfulness and
forgiveness. However, Indians don't have to partake of these gifts of Jesus in the
same way as white men, but can serve them up in true traditional style and way.
Prayer, worship, and service to others can and should be geared to the Indian soul
as it has been fashioned by God from time in memorial. Native American rituals are
happening in Pueblo adobe churches, in Navajo hogans, in Iroquis longhouses, on windswept reservations and in Indian chapels of large churches with mostly white parishioners.
What truly matters is that none of us can survive alone. Not only as individuals
is this impossible, but neither is it likely that a single family could live without
others. This is also true for communities. "No man is an island," John Dunne said
long ago. But each man, each family is unique - no other like him or it. So also
with the Indian community. It is one beautiful gem in the mosaic of God's creation.
How much better for it and all its members to acknowledge their creation by an allloving, very personal and compassionate Great Spirit who is at home with all His
people throughout the world yesterday, today and tomorrow!
Our family, drained by the struggles of the early 1970's, JOined other Indian
families all over the country in the search for peace. We found it where we least
expected it - in the traditional ideals of our ancestors, wedded and blended in
faith in Jesus. The Tekawitha Conference confirmed our own experience that it is
not only possible to be Indian and Christian, but is the best way to find both
peace and job.

1
EARACHES IN CHILDREN
Earaches are very common in children, but especially in children below the
age of five. Most earaches are caused from the common cold and cause discomfort.
When caused by the common cold the result is a build up of fluid inside the ear.
At times too much fluid collected in the ear leads to rupture of the eardrum and
there is drainage.
Sometimes earaches are caused by infection or an allergy. Another type of
earache is caused when fluid forms in the middle ear which can cause much pain.
This type of earache usually will not occur as often as the child grows older.
Infection of the ear canal often happens when children swim in poorly chlorinated pools or when someone attempts to clean wax from the ears. Doctors inform
parents that they should NEVER use bobby pins or other unclean tools to clear ears.
Even cotton swabs are not advisable. The reason is because these objects force wax
deeper into the ear and it becomes packed. Remember, the skin in the ear canal is
very thin and infection results from scratching and poking. A build up of wax
should only be removed by a physician.
Normally wax will dry and will come out of the ear by itself. Getting the
wax wet can cause it to swell and block the ear canal.
Generally if ear pain is significant and continuous, see your physician. DON'T
put medicine in the ears unless it has been prescribed by your doctor. Not even
warm oil or ear drops are advised. By doing so it may make the diagnosis even more
difficult. Some infections just don't respond to these types of remedies.
************************************************************************************
************************************************************************************
FLU
What is flu? The word flu is taken from the word influenza which is an acute
highly contagious disease. The flu usually makes us feel miserable and some of
the symtoms include headaches, coughing, sore throat, fever, muscle pains, etc.
The flu usually goes away after a few days, however you may feel tired for a week
longer.
The infection spreads by having close contact with someone who is coughing
or sneezing. Usually when one person in the family gets the flu everyone gets it.
When you have the flu it is advisable to stay home from work or school.
There are vaccines for particular types of flu expected each year. People
whose health is in danger should be vaccinated such as the elderly and people with
serious illnesses (heart, lungs, diabetes). Vaccines are not routinely recommended
for children. Immunizations are usually given in the Fall which will protect you
through the winter months. Immunity lasts about six months.
Treatment for the flu is usually keeping yourself comfortable, stay in bed,
drink liquids, light diet, aspirin and cough medicine when needed. After that it
just has to run its course.

ANNUAL TRADITIONAL VALUES SEMINAR II
On October 8-11, five area youth participated in the Second Annual Traditional
Values Seminar.
These Native students, Deanna Bailey, Lori Burd, Chuck Davidson, Paul Hart and
Gary Sheahan had the opportunity to share a unique learning experience. They were
amongst a group of approximately 60 other students.
This Youth/Elder conference was held on Mackinac Island located three miles
off shore in the Straights of Mackinac midway between Michigan's Upper and Lower
Peninsulas.
The sole objective of that four day event was to share. During those days
Elders came together to share their wisdom and cultural knowledge with our youth.
Some of the major topics that were presented were: Anishinabe - The Indigenous
People, Circle of Life/Cycles, Origin of Native People, Native Spirituality - Indigenous Way of Life, Eastern and Western Lifestyles contrasted, Our Mother Earth,
Women in Native Society, The Drum - Its Significance to Native People and Medicinal
Purpose of Plants and Herbs.
Our Elders came from all walks of life and all directions. Some of these
included: Phillip Deer - Spiritual Advisor and Keeper of the Way, George Cornell Native Studies Instructor at M.S.U., Bill Church - Director of Indian Education,
Sault Ste. Marie, Don Steavens - Consultant, Red Arrow Singers and Dancers, Bucko
Teeple - Consultant, Bay Mills, Tom & Bea Peters - Consultants, Singers & Dancers,
Red Eagle Singers - Representing Drum and It's Values, Rosemary Gaskin - Outreach
Youth Worker, Sault Ste. Marie, Hank Shaw - Guest Speaker, Al Teeple - Drummer and
Singer.
Each day started before sunrise with people getting ready for the day. A
sunrise ceremony officially kicked-off the days activities. In between breakfast,
1unch and supper an average of two mini workshops were scheduled. Some "cl asses"
were held using a natural setting as a backdrop. A few of those "classrooms" included, Arch Rock, Sugar Loaf Rock and Skull Cave. After supper we had one workshop followed by some free time.
It was not all work and no play. Bike rentals enabled the youth to tour the
Island late one afternoon. Singing, drumming and dancing often provided entertainment into the early morning hours. In between workshops, students were able to
explore the Island on their own.
In order to keep our strength up for those long and arduous days, our diet
became quite important to us. Again our Native youth shared a unique experience.
We ate buffalo roast one night, whitefish dinner the next and had a buffalo steak
fry our last night there. The food was well prepared and our cook, Rosemary Gaskin,
saw to it there was enough to go around.
As we were leaving the Island, we again had a unique opportunity. This time
to witness the skill of our ship's captain. We pulled along side a tugboat towing
a disabled freighter. When we were about three feet apart the crewmen from our
ferry tossed supplies and mail to the crew of the tug. After the transfer was comcompleted we continued on our way to Mackinaw City.
Our Autumn weather was very cooperative by providing us with a pleasant weekend.
The leaves turning their brilliant hues were peaking in northern lower Michigan.
All of this combined made for a very enjoyable weekend.
I would like to take this time to compliment those parents on how well behaved
their children were. Their level of maturity and self discipline helped to make
the Second Annual Traditional Values Seminar a huge success.

Follow-Up Report
on
The 33rd Annual Council Meeting, NMOA
September 19, 1981
There were several items recorded in the minutes of the Annual Council meeting
to which I would like to add some personal corrments and observations.
Indian Health Services at the

Saul~

Not included in the minutes were statements by Robert VanAlstine to the effect
that the Michigan BIA was not fully aware of the Indian Health Services regulations which would seem to raise serious doubts about his statement that nonreservation members must receive BIA certification prior to obtaining the services
of Indian Health Services.
Off-Reservation Hunting and Fishing
Mr. VanAlstine's response to a concern raised from the floor shows that Mr.
VanAlstine is not accurately informed on hunting and fishing rights under the 1836
Treaty. My understanding of this matter is that Federal Judge Noel P. Fox's
ruling which was supported by the Federal Appeals Court in Cincinnatti, provided
only a constitutional interpretation of the 1836 Treaty, and the determination of
blood line is left up to the Tribes involved in such Treaties.
Disposition of Judgement Claims Under the 1836 Treaty:

Adoptive Children

Mr. VanAlstine reported that the certification of adoptive non-reservation Indians
is very difficult because of the Privacy Act. While certification of adoptive
children does take longer, the following information may help to clarify what
has to be done: For certification of adoptive non-reservation Indian children,
it is necessary to obtain an adoption order from the Probate Court which handled
the adoption proceedings. This adoption order accompanied by the Indian family
tree, at least back to the 1910 Durant roll, should be submitted to the BIA.
For further information on this process, contact Audrey Ailing of the Michigan
BIA.
Indian Education
I would like to raise the following question: Are the off-reservation Indians
from Michigan receiving their fair share of BIA High.0£ducation Grants, and if not,
we need to find out why. There seems to be a larger allocation of such grants
to reservation Indians.

Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal Council - Ceta III
Classroom Training program for Native Americars
is designed to offers individuals the incentive to complete their GED/High School, or increase their basic skills in math ctnd reading.
All participants enrolled do receive supportive services, employment seeking skills and
job plctcements assistance.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO everyone who celebrated their birthday in January and
to those in February, also those in
March.

The program is designed fer individuals with
minj mum time available for training but who are
interested in attaining the academic and
technical skills necessary for employment.

Please keep up informed if your tiddress has changed. We will need to
know both your old and new address including both zip codes.

Native Americans who are considered economically disadvantage, or unemployed or receiving any kind of general assistance qualify for
CETA III.

We at the Council realize how important this
newsletter is to the Native American Community
as well as the other agencies.
In the past few months the Council has been in
process of reorganizing, due to so many budget cuts. It has become necessary to lay-off
some of our permanent staff.
We lost our Turtle Talk Editor and it became
necessary for the Council to shift this responsibility to each department and to take on
other responsibilities as well.
The Council will not· know until April or May

The CETA Program has been very effective in
decreasing the 70% drop-out rate among Indian
people. It has been very hard for some
students to return to school for many reasons.
We applaud the efforts of both the Ceta III
participants and the CETA III staff.

Chlldrens' Christmas Shopping Tour
Held December 8, 1981. The purpose
of this event is to all underprivileged
children in the GR area to experience
the joy of giving at Christmas.
The
Jaycees gave each child money to be
used to purchase gifts for their family
and friends.
This year the Jaycees provided (35)
children from the Native American Community, the opportunity to experience
t~e joy of giving.
lhree of those
children were not able to participant.
In the GR area a total of (230) children were choosen from other agencies
and schools.
Our main goal was to find as many
children as we possibly could, who have
participated in the past years and
who come from a low income household.
Many children could not oo due to the
limited number of children the Jaycees
alotted us.

NATIVE AMERICAN EDUCATION PROGRAM,
TITLE IV, PART A, NEWS:
On December 18, 1981, the Title IV
Program hosted a Christmas Party at
the Westside Comples.
The part was a
great sucess with (175) children attending along with their ~arents.
The
children were treated with lots of
Christmas goodies.
Lawrence Shananaquet entertained the
children with a guessing game that
kept them on their toes.
BRET SHOMIN
was the lucky winner of that game.
GOOD JOB BRET!
While ~e all waited for Santa to arrive, Mickey Mouse dropped in to say
"MERRY CHRISTMAS." Along with Mickey
Mouse, was one of Santa's Elves enjoying the party and eargerly waiting for
Santa too!
Then the magic moment came
and Santa arrived.
The children were
very happy to see Santa and Santa was
happy also to see that so many children were waiting just for him. All
the children received gifts, even the
little babies had a new toy for Christmas.
The Title IV Programs Christmas party
was more than an over whelming sucess,
it was an out pour of care, love, and
concern that it has for our Indian
children in the community.
We would like to THANK the many people
who made it all possible. They are:
Jeanette St. Clair our Title IV Program Coordinator and her valuable staff
members, Janet and Gary Shomin, Carol
and Lawrence Shananaquet, Sue Russo,
Dave Martell, Roger and Georgianna
Martell and Ted Hooksma.

"THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR MANY Unselfish efforts.
A BIG THANKS goes out to Santa's
helpers who wrapped gifts and to the
retail stores that donated toys,
candy and also the many private donations. GR Inter-Tribal Council
also contributed toward the purchase
of gifts. We would also like to
"THANK" Mr. Rich Doneley for donating the use of the Westside Complex.
There were many people too numerous to
mention who helped with picking up donations, serving refreshments and
cleaning up the complex afterwards.
I would personally like to take this
time to say "THANK YOU" to all the
people who helped in giving the children a wonderful Christmas party. Without their loving efforts it would not
have been possible.

TRIBUTE TO WAUNETTA DOMINIC
December 31, 1981

By:

Joe John

Anyone who knew Waunetta Dominic knew
that throughout her life she fought
for the rights of her people.
I was
privileged to know her and work with
her for many years---before and during the time I was chairman of the
Northern Michigan Ottawa Association
Unit //4.
She worked alongside her father,
Levi McClellan, and continued throughout her married life with her, husband, Bob, and after both were gone.
Al though all her battles w~r.:_e not over
and she did not live to see the distribution of the lands settlement of
Ottawas and Chippewas, she played a
major role in the courts on defining
Indian for the distribution, an issue
which has gone for years.
Waunetta Dominic also battled with the
Interior Department, the State of
Michigan and the Department of Natural
Resources in the treaty fishing court
cases. She argued that they were not
dealing with the right people, that
they were dealing with some who were
more white than Indian, and should not
be entitled to commercial fishing
rights.
She said that only Michigan
Indians were entitled to fishing benefits should be those who could trace
their ancestory to Indians listed on
the Durant Roll of 1910.

She had spent many years tracing the
1910 roll but her pleadings fell on
deaf ears and so Bay Mills and the
Sault Band were awarded treaty fishing
rights while non-reservation Indians
were not.
She was not afraid to be outspoken and
pointed out that when treaties were
written the US Government would not
deal with anyone who did not have
half Indian blood or more.
She objected to the broadening of the definition to 1/32 or 1/64 Indian.
Both she and Bob believed strongly in
education for Indian young people but
they, also, promoted preservation of
their culture and heritage.
They believed the answer to the future was in
getting an education or technical
training in order to get ahead in today's world.
She also believed that
the Indians and white man had to work
out the problems together and that the
more they understood each other, the
better they would get along.
In December 1948, when the claims against the US for underpayment for much
of Michigan were filed, the Northern
Michigan Ottawa Association came into
being.
Because of the
lack of faith in the US Government
because of the shameful record of
broken treaties, only a few Indians
were present.
Bob Dominic was elected
president and held that post until
death in 1976.
Waunetta took over then and held it
throughout her life. She never lost
hope that the claims would ultimately be honored·
Many m~tters a:e ~et
to be settled and it will be di ff icul t
to find leadership.
No one can replace Waunetta Dominic and she will be
sadly missed by all who knew her.

A SHORT RUN DOWN ON OUR 1836 CLAIMS

A Short Run Down on Our 1836 Claims cont'd
Also at our meeting in Mount Pleasant,
Dave Dominic was nominated to replace his
mother as our chairman of the descendants
committee. Anyone (descendant on 1836 claim)
wishing to work on this committee contact
Dave at R#2, Uox 157; Bark River, Mi 49807.
Also anyone wishing to write for verification
or certification of Indian Ancestory should
write to our Vice President of Northern

Waunetta Dominic's illness started the mail has
been piling up and creating quite a problem
since we did not have anyone designated to care
for such a bulk of mail under these circumstances.
I appreciated the "Tribute to Waunetta Dominic"
by Joe John in the March 1982 Turtle Talk very
much as I'm sure many of you did. It was well
stated, Thank-You Joe. And as Joe stated, "she
never lost hope that our claims would ultimately be honored", we should do likewise.

AN ANSWER TO INDIAN AND CHRISTIAN: IS IT
POSSIBLE (November issue of Turtle Talk)
I'd like to quote from Sa-go-ye-wat-te Red
Jacket, Seneca, to Missionary Cran: "Brother,
continue to listen. You say that you are sent
to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit
agreeable to His mind; and if we do not take
hold of the religion which you white people
teach, we shall be unhappy hereafter. You
say that you are right, and we are lost. How
do you know this to be true? We understand
that your religion is written in a book. If it
was intended for us as well as you, why has not
the Great Spirit given to us and not only to
us, but to our forefathers - the knowledge of
that book, with the means of understanding it
rightly? We only know what you tell us about
it.
How shall we know when to believe, being so
often deceived by the white people?
Brother, we do not wish to destroy your religion or take it from you; we only want to enjoy
our own.

Brother, we have told that you have been
preaching to the white people in this place.
These people are our neighbors: We are
acquainted with then. We will wait a little
while and see what effect your preaching
has upon them. If we find it does them good,
makes then honest and less disposed
to cheat Indians, we will consider again of
what you have said. End of quote.
We feel as Traditional "Nishenabig, that the
words of Sa-go-ye-wat-ha, have the selfsame
impact on the Native vs White mind it had on
that long ago day. No evidence can be produced todayby converted Apples and Uncle
Tomahawks to show christianity and the
millions buried by the christian churches, as
christian, has improved our "Nishenabig one
iota". It is silly to equate material and
scientific improvements with christianity,
for most materialists and scientist are and
al~ays have been opposed by the leadership
of christianity.
Nishenabig who attended the Tekawitha Conference, have every right to do so, but the
conclusion that one can mix traditionalism
~nd christianity into a workable a religion
is at best a cop-out and at it's worst an
o~tright lie.
Bob Ingersall said: "If you
mix four gallons of good oil into one gallon
of bad oil, you do not have five gallons of
good oil; you have five gallons of bad oil."
So simply one can not weld iron to mud!
More-over, if one refuses to learn from history, then he is forced to re-live it's
lessons. To see the true character of
christianity, look about you, in this christianized USA there is more crime, rape, murder, drunkeness, child abuse, suicide, insanity, and broken home, than in all Asia, with
it's teaming millions of non-christians! A
deep look into Ireland (from which more
priests are exported, than any other country)
christians are murdering each other with
bombs, bullets and other wonderful inventions.
Personally I do not want this viewpoint of socalled religion, imported into any Nishenabig community!
There are Indian con-artists, educated into
christian value systems, some for a bast buck,
or on some ego trip, do join forces with the
church. In the Fur-Slave raiders - Removal
wars, some Indians were involved in raping
of the fur-bearing animals, and some caught
other tribes citizens, and sold them into
slavery to the French, some led European
Armies to attach other Indian tribes.
Every race has this type of people who justify their filthy actions for some earthly
gain, ego trips or whatever. However, let us
not equate this attitude as a good one for todays Indians to follow.

Unlike Sa..go-y_a..wat-te's people, Nishenabig did
and to have a book the Walam Olum, and a religion the Meday. It isn't destroyed yet! It
simply was forced into hiding because of muder,
death threats and other means of force. The
self-same KITANITOWIT still rules both heaven
and earth. In ancient prayerful attitude one
may still receive His blessings, TRADITIONAL
MANNER! Not one bit of alcohol, nor drugs,
nor altar wine is Tradional in any way.

borrow books, and she read a lot.

OF
JEANETTE ST. CLAIR
.

Editor's Note: This is the third in ~e~~r~~sh.
of articles about minority women in
ic igan who have achieved success.
If ten people were shown a single long-stemmed
red rose and asked to write a description of
of it, the result would be ten completely
different essays. One might dwell on the
flower's poignant smell, another might emphasize its prickly stem or its symbolism; but
each would write according to their varied
experiences and associations with the flower.
Jeanette St. Clair, Native American Education
Coordinator with the Grand Rapids Public
Schools, is extremely sensitive to the fact
that individuals are shaped by their own personal experiences, and she is not one to generalize about Native Americans and the problems
they face growing up in a white-dominated
society. Rather, she can tell of her own ex~
periences and where they led.
She was born Jeanette Kosequate, the eldest
child and only daughter in a family of boys.
Her family lived in the Indian community of
Good Hart, northwest of Petoskey.
As a preschool child, she spent a great deal of
time with her grandparents who spoke only
Ottawa, and she attended St. Ignatius Church,
where the white priest also spoke Ottawa.
By the time she was ready to start school, her
parents had moved to Frankfort, where her
father was a wheelman on a car ferry. The
idea of attending school in an English-speaking classroom was frightening to her. Her
parents did not force, instead they allowed
Jeanette to return to Good Hart. There she
lived with her grandparents for a year, until
her brother Joe had spent more time with white
youngsters, and he could speak more English.
For years he was to serve as spokeman for his
sister in class.
Jeanette spent summers with her grandparents.
After her grandfather died, when Jeanette was
about 12 years old, the family moved back to
Good Hart. She was transferred to Indian
Boarding School in Harbor Springs, 17 miles
away.
Life at the school was regimented, and the
children weren't allowed to go home even for
Christmas. Jeanette feels that perhaps the
worst part of life there was the lack of
cultural experiences.
When the family didn't have money to finance
schooling, the children returned to Good Hart.
As Jeanette recalls~ no one from the state
checked on them, but someone allowed her to

A family benefactor . made it possible for th
the children to return to classes, and
Jeanette was sent to Petoskey to live with a
white family and attend public high school.
Separated from Joe for the first time and
adjusting to living in a white home proved
more than Jeanette felt she could handle.
She told her mother this, and her mother
found an Indian family with which she could
live. Looking back on this stage of her life,
Jeanette recalls that she was quiet, studied
hard and minded her own business.
About tenth grade, Jeanette decided she
wanted to enter a convent. Over her mother's
objections, she moved to Milwaukee with the
Sisters of Notre Dame, where she finished
high school, and went on to join the order.
This association was to last 15 years.
The order, weighing her academic record, decided she should become a science and math
teacher. After a year of cloistered life,
when she spoke to no one except the novice
mistress, she took her final vows. She
then began teaching religious schools and
attending college at the same time, but she
left the order in 1955.
According to Jeanette, because of the outdoor
background, she'd been given permission by the
head of her order to take walks whenever she
felt the need. When she was sent to Fort
Wayne, Indiana, to teach, the superior there
wouldn't allow Jeanette to go for walks. The
superior's strictness and the confinement
were more than Jeanette could handle, and
she left the order.
After leaving the convent she came to Grand
Rapids and taught, finishing her degree at
Aquinas. It took 13 years to get that degree
because she always went part-time. Since
then she met and married her husband Percy,
and they have their daughters Patrice and Liz.
In the late '60's Jeanette met Chet Eagleman.
Sharing an awareness of the isolation of
Native Americans in Grand Rapids, Jeanette
assisted Chet as one of the co-fonders of the
Grand Rapids Inter-Tribal Council.
Jeanette and Chet often talked about the
special needs of Indian students, and their
high drop out rate. Many of the students felt
a reluctance about going to strangers for
help and consequently were unaware of services
available to them.
There was a definite need for a Native American Counselor to serve these students, and
Jeanette wanted to be able to help. She took
a leave of absence to attend Michigan State

ACTS ABOUT TREATY FISHING - cont'd.
"BUT AREN'T INDIAN VIOLATORS JUST GIVEN A
SLAP ON THE WRIST IN TRIBAL COURT?"
Regulations are enforced by tribal conservation committeess, concervation officers and
the Chippewa-Ottawa court which includes a
non-Indian tribal prosecutor and judge, both
hired by the treaty tribes to carry out the
regulations.
Scrutiny of tribal fishers is more intense
because DNR federal and tribal c(flservation
officers are all authorized to enforce tribal
regulations.

In addition, there are pro-

portionately more tribal officers for tribal
fishers than state officers for sport and

is not destroying the fishery.

Because the

state has no adequate measure of the sportfisher harvest, comparison figures are not
available, but is known that the treaty
harvest is significatly smaller than the
state-licensed sport and commercial harvest.
In 1981, tribal fishers harvested J.4 million
pounds of fish, approximately 30 percent of
the total (treaty and non-treaty) commercial
catch.

Of that amount, incidental catch

of

lake trout by treaty fishers amounted to only
16 percent of the total treaty harvest.

In addition, trap nets can only be

There are other drawbacks.

The DNR's own re-

suffocation as the net is pulled to the surface .

FACTS ABOUT TREATY FISHING
Indian people have been fishinq in the Great
Lakes for 12,000 years, but in the last decade
they have had to defend their traditJonal
livelihood in federal court.
As a result of misinformation and misunderstandings, Indian people now find themselves
accused of depleting a fishery which is an

RIGHT TO AN UNLIMITED CATCH?"
No.

Federal court decisions limit the treaty

harvest of all species to the amount of fish

Allowable Catch (TAC) and is determined by

In 1814, certain groups of Chippewa and
Ottawa Indians were recognized as sovereign
nations in a treaty that ended the War of 1812.
Under the Treaty of 1836, these same groups

gave up millions of acres of land which now
comprise two-thirds of Michigan but retained
their hunting and fishing rights.
It was a bargain struck by the U. S. government and the tribes which allowed the government to open the area to settlement and admit

The treaty rights, by law, are handed down as
property rights to the political successors of
the original treaty tribes. The courts have
delared that they are the Sault Ste. Marie
Tribe of Chippewa Indians, the Bay Mills
Indian Community and the Grand Traverse Band
of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.

the zone is closed to treaty fishers--even
when they account for a small percentage of
that quota.
Tribal regulations also establish sanctuaries
which close certain areas to treaty fishing
by any method, for purpose in order to allow
for lake trout restoration and minimize the
conflict with recreational fishing.
Regulations do permit the retention and sale
of lake trout and other game fish caught while
target fishing for non-game species, but lake
trout represent a small percentage of the
total treaty harvest.
If the state believes tribal regulation is inadequate, it may petition the court to change
regulations or allow state regulation.

which orginally was called the All Souls
Supper. This brief article will attempt
to describe how this traditon was practiced
among the Little Traverse Band of Ottawas and
Chippewas in the 1930's as I remember it.
My grandmother, Mary Gibson, passed this tradition on to me, and I practiced it until I
left home. The All Souls Supper was a ritual
tradition in which indians paid respect and
remembered those members who had died. This
ritual tradition parallels in many ways the
Christian, especially Roman Catholic tradition
of remembering their dead.
The All Souls Supper was held annually during
the first four days of November. The elders
of each family invited the guests to come to
their home and eat. Each family invited
was supposed to represent a particular deceased member of the inviting elder's
immediate family.

Each invited guest was told

which deceased member he or she represented.
Once the guests were seated, my grandmother,
before the meal was served, would take a small
portion of each serving and place it in the
fire of the wood burning stove.
This offering of food into the fire was accompanied by an invitation for each of the deceased members remembered to come and share in
the meal.
After this offering the meal was then served.
When everyone had finished eating, my grandmother would reset the table and set out
another complete serving of food. She would
cover the table setting with a table cloth.
This was done to allow those deceased family
members who might have been forgotten to come
and eat during the night. My grandmother and
the elders actually believed that they heard
the table rattle when they awoke during their
sleep, as the deceased members came to eat.
It was from this belief that this traditon
came to be called the Ghost Supper.
It was also during these first four days of
November that another ritual traditon showing
respect to one's family deceased members was
practiced. The graves of the deceased were
redecorated. The Indians took multi-colored
crepe paper and fashioned them into flowers.
These crepe paper flowers were placed in the
form of a wreath on the wooden crosses which
marked each grave. The wooden crosses which
had weathered or were deteriorating were replaced with new crosses.
One time my grandmother was question by a
non-Indian as to her belief that deceased
souls really came to eat. She responded with
question to the doubting questioner, "Do you
actually believe that your deceased come up to
smell the flowers which you place on their
graves on Memorial Day or Decoration Day?

the most difficult times of my life

At the invitation of

the Northport Public Schools the
students attended a Fall Harvest
Feast sponsored by Northport Title IV.
Mr. John Bailey was the narrator of the
program.

He spoke of the meanings of

Indian singing, drumming, and dancing
Our students were asked to sing and r m
while some local dancers in traditional
dress performed various Native
American dances.
The program also included several displays of Indian arts and crafts and

corn soup, fry bread, and cider for
those who wished to experience those
traditional Indian foods.
The Harvest Feast was attended by
approximately (600) students and
adults, two Traverse City television

their daily r outine, and exposure to
a variety of cultural and educational
experiences so that they would
be better equipped to make vocational
choices and pursue leisure-time
interests.

Early on we set rules

governing allowances for household
chores, and expected that the
children would come, through trial and
error, to

~ake

sound financial

decisions based on the income they
earned.
As the children grew, we concerned
ourselves with their social behavior,
their adjustment to school, their
coping skills with adolescence, and
finally, with their ability to function away from the nest.
Surprisingly enough, they have all
made it to adulthood, save one, still
living at thome.

Parenting is work,

with much planning for the future
involved.

If your mobility and stamina

are hampered, so, too, ls your
about retirement (if you're not already activity level.
I bring this up, interestingly enough,

retired).

But,retirement planning,

if successful, needs to include some

of these same elements we have
credence to when rearing our children.
We need to reflect on the factors that
contribute to well being-- some of the
same principles we tried to instill
in our children.

For example, living

healthful lifestyle is as important
for a child preparing for adulthood
as it is for persons, say in their
forties preparing for whatever their
future may hold in retirement.

Like-

wise, learning to plan for the fiscal
responsibility of one's finances is as
imporLanL in the rearing of a child as
it is for the person who, as an adult,
looks forward to the day he'll be able
to travel, spend more time with
friends, or just play golf.
Most people spend an average of 15
years in retirement, but considerably
less than that in planning for their

Plan for where you'd like to live.
If it's another city, does it have
options, or business and educational
opportur1i tie you' re looking for?
Consider how you'll spend your time.
(Behavior patterns are not easily
changed--if you want a full active
life,don't wait till retirement to
get involved.)
If a second career is
on the horizon, find out now all the
pros andcons of making a career
change and take steps, be they through
continued education, volunteer
opportunities, or first-hand
experience, to enhance your knowledge
about that potential career choice.
Make an effort to learn a new hobby
and to make friends outside of your
business associates.
Take a close look at your expected
income in retirement, then project
anticipated expenses.
Recognizing
that we live in an inflationary
world, try to develop a financial
plan now that will hopefully ensure
sufficient income to adequately
maintain your standard of living
after retirement.
Think positively.

Retirement does not necessarily mean
"retiring from something" in the
your retirement years are rewarding,

It can be perceived
"as
